/*
 * Host-side model of the dsPIC33AK clock register file, for the Clock HAL's
 * structural tests.  Only src/app/hal_clock/nora_clock_dspic33ak_reg.c includes
 * <xc.h>, so this is the whole of what has to be faked: the core and the device
 * table compile on the host against nothing at all.
 *
 * WHY THE MODEL MOVES BY ITSELF
 *   The register layer waits on hardware.  Every switch commit is followed by a
 *   poll -- WAIT_CLEAR(OSWEN), WAIT_CLEAR(DIVSWEN), and the combined
 *   "CLKRDY && COSC == source" loop -- with a budget of 1,000,000 iterations
 *   before it gives up with a timeout diagnostic.  A fake made of plain
 *   variables never clears those bits, so every one of those loops would spin to
 *   its budget and the suite would test the timeout path and nothing else.
 *
 *   So the model has a sequencer: nora_fake_clock_tick() is called on EVERY
 *   register access and advances any commit in flight, completing it after
 *   NORA_FAKE_SEQUENCER_TICKS observations.  A commit therefore takes a few poll
 *   iterations to finish, which is what the loops under test are for.
 *
 * WHY THE ACCESSORS ARE FUNCTIONS
 *   xc.h maps each SFR name to a call, e.g. CLK1CONbits -> (*nora_fake_clkcon(1u)),
 *   because that is the only hook a plain `CLK1CONbits.ON = 1;` in the code under
 *   test will run through.  The consequence is worth stating: a pointer accessor
 *   CANNOT TELL A READ FROM A WRITE, so this model has no write counter.  Tests
 *   that need to prove "no register was written" preset a field to a value the
 *   sequence under test would necessarily change (see the OE witness in
 *   test_nora_clock_contract.c) and assert it survived.
 *
 * WHY THE FIELDS ARE uint32_t AND NOT BITFIELDS
 *   These structs model FIELDS, NOT BIT POSITIONS.  Real bit offsets live in the
 *   DFP and are not knowledge this suite has or needs -- the code under test only
 *   ever names fields.  Bitfields would also make every `x.ON = 1` a truncating
 *   store under /W4 /WX.  The word accessors below compose a value from the
 *   fields at positions this file invented, so NO TEST MAY ASSERT A RAW WORD
 *   LAYOUT; they exist so that a raw capture is a coherent function of the model
 *   state, which is what makes "generator 6 reads CLK6 and not CLK8" testable.
