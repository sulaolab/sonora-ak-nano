/*
 * The backend on a part WITHOUT the full CCP register inventory must REPORT that,
 * not silently pretend to work.
 *
 * This replaces an older gate that compiled the PUBLIC header for AK128 and
 * required it to fail unless an opt-in macro was defined. That gate stopped
 * meaning anything once device selection moved out of the public header and into
 * the backend's DFP capability test: the public header is now deliberately
 * device-neutral, so of course it compiles for any
 * part -- the old test could only have passed by contradicting the design.
 *
 * What still needs guarding is the rule the design does assert: "a capability that
 * only one target can implement must report that fact; it must not be silently
 * ignored." So this compiles the BACKEND against a CCP9-less fake xc.h and checks
 * every entry point answers "not available". Two failure modes it catches that a
 * header-compile test cannot:
 *
 *   - an entry point added to the full-map branch only, so a part without the
 *     inventory fails to LINK (this happened to nora_ccp_icap_irq_clear when it
 *     was introduced);
 *   - a stub that returns OK / true, which would let a caller believe capture is
 *     running on hardware that has none.
 *
 * No SFR definitions here on purpose: with the table compiled out, the backend must
 * not reference a single CCP register. If this file ever needs one to link, that is
 * itself the bug.
