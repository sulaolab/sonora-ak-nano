/* The reference settings from the bench sweeps:
 * all three analog knobs saturate, so these sit just past their knees, and the
 * signal-to-noise is bought with accumulation depth instead.
 *
 * Re-measured 2026-08-14 against the tracked noise tail rather than a six-sample
 * spread: the analog knobs are flatter than the first sweep reported (the tail does
 * not move at all across CVDCAP 0-7, charge 500-5000 ns or balance 250-4000 ns),
 * and depth is worth less than it first reported -- ~3x from 2^4 to 2^8, not ~40x,
 * because the absolute tail grows 5x while the count grows 16x.
 *
 * Two corrections, 2026-08-15, after re-reading the ITC hardware documentation,
 * because the text
 * above was wrong in a way that closed off real levers:
 *
 *  - 2^8 is NOT "the maximum". ACCCNT[3:0] accepts up to 15, and ITCRESx is
 *    32-bit signed, so 2^15 would not overflow either. What stops us is the scan
 *    rate: 2^8 gives ~146 scan/s and every further doubling halves it, which
 *    collides with the 4-scan moving average below and with the ~5-scan plateau
 *    of a short real tap. The constraint is this file, not the hardware.
 *
 *  - The sweeps those flat results came from were taken under a measurement
 *    condition the data sheet rules out: all three electrodes were floating when
 *    idle (TRISx = 1, now fixed at the integration point in main.c, DS p.1487),
 *    and the board's touch shield copper was being held statically High by
 *    BOARD_DBG_PIN_E4 through R10 = 100 ohm. So "the knobs are flat" is a
 *    statement about that broken condition, not about this hardware, and CVDCAP
 *    is worth re-sweeping once both are corrected -- scored on
 *    min(light-touch mag) - max(idle tail), not on the idle tail alone. */
/* 5,000 ns, not 2,000, and both halves of the metric moved -- measured on AK512
 * 2026-08-30 with the shield grounded and the idle electrodes tied, which is the
 * first time this knob has been swept under the documented measurement condition
 * (the 2026-08-14 sweep that concluded "the knobs are flat" was taken with the
 * shield held at VDD and the electrodes floating, which the ITC hardware
 * documentation rules out as a measurement condition).
 *
 * Idle tail, peak-to-trough over matched 16 s windows, CVDAN10:
 *   1000 ns 1268   2000 ns 1184   3000 ns 1026   5000 ns 974
 * and the accumulated raw count moves less than 0.4 % across all four, so this is
 * not a gain change. Touch magnitude went *up* as well: CVDAN10 taps read 994..1408
 * against 808..1107 at 2,000 ns -- a longer charge lets the electrode reach the
 * rail, so the finger's added capacitance is a larger share of what is measured.
 *
 * Consequence on the pad that was the problem: CVDAN10's idle_ref fell from
 * 137..181 to 92..118, so max(FLOOR_MIN, idle_ref * FLOOR_MULT) stopped clearing
 * FLOOR_MIN and all three pads now learn to 700. That is what the FLOOR_MAX cap
 * was papering over.
 *
 * Cost: 199 -> 110 scans/s (each of the 2 samples charges for 3 us longer, 2^8
 * times). The 4-scan magnitude window is then 36 ms and debounce 2 scans is 18 ms,
 * both still well inside a tap, and the operator's verdict at 5,000 ns was "light
 * from the first press" on pads 1 and 2.
 *
 * 5,000 ns is close to the ceiling: TMRA is 8-bit in TAD, and 2,000 ns is already
 * 100 TAD, so 5,000 ns is 250 TAD. A larger value is refused by
 * nora_touch_set_acquisition() rather than silently truncated. 3,000 ns (150 TAD,
 * idle tail 1026, ~150 scans/s) is the middle option if the scan rate is needed
 * back. */

/* --- per-pad learning (header: learn_presses) -------------------------------
 *
 * The pad teaches the library its own press amplitude, because measuring the
 * quiet pad cannot: that was tried on 2026-08-14 -- thresholds from each pad's
 * idle noise tail -- and it was measured wrong on hardware. Pad 1 had the
 * *smallest* tail and needed the *highest* threshold, so the tail does not
 * predict the press. Only a press predicts the press.
 *
 * That forces the shape of this code: two thresholds, not one.
 *
 *   candidate  low, learns, never fires an event
 *   press      the one the app sees, moved once enough presses are known
 *
 * Without the candidate the design cannot start: a first touch below the press
 * threshold produces no event *and* no sample, so the pad would never learn what
 * it just failed to detect. With it, the first touch after a boot may well be
 * missed as an event while still being recorded as evidence -- which is the
 * accepted trade (operator decision 2026-08-14: a poor first touch is allowed).
 *
 * candidate = max(idle_ref * CAND_MULT, CAND_MIN), where idle_ref is a decaying
 * maximum of the key's own quiet magnitude. Decaying, not all-time: the noise is
 * low-frequency drift (A.7), so an all-time peak would ratchet up and never come
 * back down, and the candidate would drift out from under the learner.
 *
 * An excursion must hold for LEARN_RUN scans before it counts, so a single bad
 * conversion cannot manufacture a sample, and CAND_MIN keeps the candidate above
 * the idle magnitudes actually measured.
 *
 * CAND_MIN is 800, and it has been raised twice by the same argument: each time,
 * a longer idle run produced magnitudes the previous number sat inside. 600 was
 * set from a run of minutes; over a 3 h 7 min soak on 2026-08-15 two pads produced
 * quiet-pad excursions of 679 and 711, i.e. 600 was again inside the noise, and
 * the samples they fed the learner were noise recorded as presses. The lightest
 * touch measured is 780 and real taps fire at 826..1,520, so 800 still excludes
 * nothing a finger does -- but note that 780 says the headroom above is now thin,
 * and a third rise would start refusing real presses. If a longer soak clears 800,
 * the answer is no longer this constant: it is a slower idle_ref or a pad that
 * needs its own pinned pair.
 *
 * The history, kept because the reasoning is what transfers: 600 was not the 400
 * first tried, and that difference was measured,
 * not argued. 400 came from the A.7 trace, whose idle windows reached 317. Over a
 * longer idle run on the same board the tracked extremes are wider -- |delta| to
 * 895 and four-scan magnitudes past 470 -- so a 400 gate sits *inside* the noise:
 * the learner recorded quiet-pad excursions as presses, the median came out small,
 * the clamp pinned press at its floor, and the board then fired events with
 * nobody touching it (observed 2026-08-14, "press, mag 402" on an untouched pad).
 * The gate has to clear the noise the pad actually produces over minutes, not the
 * noise it produced during one seventeen-scan trace -- and, as the soak above then
 * showed, over hours and not merely minutes.
 *
 * LEARN_RUN is 3 for the same reason: a real touch spans dozens of scans, so
 * asking for three consecutive windows costs a press nothing, while a noise
 * excursion that clears the candidate for one window rarely clears it for three.
 * Rarely, and not never: the two 2026-08-15 excursions did clear three, which is
 * the other half of why the constant had to move rather than the run length.
 *
 * press = second-smallest(samples) * NUM/DEN, capped at the configured default and
 * then raised to max(FLOOR_MIN, idle_ref * FLOOR_MULT) -- floor last, so the floor
 * outranks the cap.
 *
 *   sample  the second-smallest recorded press (the smallest, below four
 *           samples), because the threshold must clear the weakest press rather
 *           than the average one -- see nora_touch_learn_apply() for the run of
 *           firm taps that showed a median cannot do this. Second-smallest and not
 *           smallest so one unusually light excursion cannot drag the pad alone.
 *   NUM/DEN 35/100, and the fraction is small because of what it multiplies. A
 *           sample is the *peak* magnitude of the excursion, whereas the threshold
 *           is crossed on the way up: measured 2026-08-14, the same taps peaked at
 *           1,400..2,400 while firing at 826..1,520, so peaks run about 1.5x the
 *           magnitude that has to be cleared. 45/100 was derived from A.7.1's
 *           *fire-time* figures and then applied to peaks, which is a unit
 *           mismatch, and it landed the three pads at 700/638/665 -- 28..40 % above
 *           the hand-tuned 500. Against peaks, 35 % of the second-smallest gives
 *           496/517/560, i.e. it converges onto the pair a bench operator chose,
 *           while still leaving 1.65x to the lightest press measured.
 *   ceiling the configured default is *known* to work on this hardware, so
 *           learning is never allowed to make a pad less sensitive than the value
 *           it shipped with -- unless the floor says otherwise, which is why the
 *           floor is applied after it.
 *   floor   max(FLOOR_MIN, FLOOR_MULT times the pad's own quiet magnitude), because
 *           below that the key presses itself. Both halves are needed and neither
 *           is sufficient: an absolute clamp inside the noise band turns every
 *           noise improvement into a loss of protection (measured: 500 gave 21
 *           false presses in 30 min on an untouched board, and the *noisier*
 *           configuration had had none), while a purely relative floor collapses
 *           with idle_ref -- at idle 74 it was 222, which stopped nothing. See
 *           FLOOR_MIN / FLOOR_MULT for the soak numbers behind 700 and 6.
 */
/* Presses before the pair is set for the first time -- a minimum, not a quota.
 * The pair is recomputed on every press after this one, over a median of up to
 * SAMPLES_MAX, so the estimate keeps improving without the threshold waiting for
 * it.
 *
 * Three, not five, and the acceptance criterion is what fixes it: from a
 * default-only power-up, ten taps per pad with no miss from the third tap
 * onwards (operator, 2026-08-14). A one-shot rule that converged at the fifth
 * press could not meet that -- taps three and four would still be judged by the
 * shipped 700, which is exactly the threshold the light taps fall under. Three
 * is the largest minimum that still has the pad learned before the first tap the
 * criterion counts.
 *
 * The cost of deciding on three samples instead of five is bounded rather than
 * argued: the ceiling in nora_touch_learn_apply() is the configured pair, so an
 * unlucky median cannot take the pad under the floor -- FLOOR_MIN, or FLOOR_MULT
 * times its own idle magnitude, whichever is larger -- and the next press
 * recomputes it from one more sample. */

/* The floor: max(FLOOR_MIN, idle_ref * FLOOR_MULT), and both halves moved on
 * 2026-08-15 because 500/3 was measured to invert -- improving the noise floor
 * *removed* protection. The mechanism, from the 30-minute soaks:
 *
 *   CVDAN10 was quiet in the 20:29 baseline *because its noise was high*.
 *   idle_ref 236 * 3 = 708 beat FLOOR_MIN, so its threshold was the shipped 700
 *   and it saw zero false presses. Grounding the idle electrodes (DS70005591C
 *   p.1487) then cut idle_ref to 123, 369 fell under 500, the absolute clamp won,
 *   and the threshold landed *inside* the pad's own noise band (measured 502..596)
 *   -- fifteen false presses in thirty minutes on an untouched board, where the
 *   noisier configuration had had none.
 *
 * So an absolute clamp that sits inside the noise band turns every noise
 * improvement into a loss of protection. 700 is the smallest value the hardware
 * has been measured clean at: 700 gave 0 events in 31 min, 900 gave 0 in 34 min
 * (08-14) and 31 min (08-15), 500 gave 21 in 30 min. It is also still under every
 * deliberate tap -- the lightest measured was 1,085 after the RE4 shield fix and
 * 528 before it, and the only taps that ever came under 700 were the 4th/5th of a
 * fast six-tap burst, i.e. partial contact.
 *
 * MULT is 6 rather than 3 so the relative half keeps a vote at the noise levels
 * this board actually shows: with FLOOR_MIN at 700, a MULT of 3 would need
 * idle_ref past 233 to matter at all, which is above anything measured since the
 * electrodes were grounded (66..146). Six puts the crossover at 117, so a pad
 * whose noise creeps up is still protected above the flat 700 -- which is exactly
 * what saved CVDAN10 in the baseline, and the capability this pair is meant to
 * preserve rather than replace.
 *
 * Consequence, deliberately accepted: with FLOOR_MIN equal to the shipped default
 * (700), learning can no longer make a pad *more* sensitive than shipped -- the
 * floor and the ceiling meet. Downward learning below 700 was measured unsafe on
 * this hardware (it is what produced the 21 events), so this is the point rather
 * than a side effect; what learning still does is scale release with press, raise
 * a noisy pad above 700, and clear the cold gate. An integrator who needs a
 * lighter pad than 700 sets it explicitly -- nora_touch_set_key_thresholds pins

 * is still millimetres from the pad 40 ms after a release, and what it couples in

 *   idle 170 -> 900   idle 179 -> 900   idle 166 -> 900
 *
 * against real presses of 870..1151 on that pad: the threshold landed *inside*
 * the tap distribution, so the same press worked or did not depending on what the
 * previous release had left behind. Resting idle_ref on that pad, minutes later,
 * is 90..110.

 *
 * This, not s_all_quiet, is what protects the pad being tapped -- while one pad is

 * a sample means a finger. Measured 2026-08-15, it does not: over a 3 h 7 min soak
 * with nobody in the room, two of the three pads recorded a sample and lifted
 * their own gate (CVDAN10 at mag 679 after 7 min, CVDAN8 at mag 711 after 15 min)
 * while the event side, correctly, reported nothing at all. The learning path is
 * deliberately more permissive than detection -- that is what lets a pad learn
 * from a touch too light to report -- so it is exactly the wrong thing to ask
 * "was that a human". Only an event answers that, so only an event lifts the gate.
 *
 * Hence a stored flag rather than a function of learn_n: the two now mean
 * different things, and the flag is cleared at the one place a press is reported.
 * It has to be re-armed everywhere the learning state is cleared, and it is --
 * init, nora_touch_calibrate() and nora_touch_set_acquisition().
 *
 * Independent of learn_presses on purpose: with learning switched off the shipped
 * pair never moves, and a pad that has never been touched should still be the
 * stricter of the two. The gate is about whether a human has arrived, not about
 * calibration.
 *
 * Both accessors are one-sided: the cold pair may only make a pad stricter. A
 * configuration whose cold values are the weaker ones is a mistake that would
 * raise sensitivity before anything is known about the pad, which is the opposite
 * of what the gate is for, so it is ignored rather than obeyed.
