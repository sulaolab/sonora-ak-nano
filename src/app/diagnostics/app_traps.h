/*
 * app_traps.h -- the dsPIC33AK hardware trap vectors, once, plus the boot-time report of
 * a trap that happened BEFORE this boot.
 *
 * PORTED FROM CK, AND FROM THIS REPO'S OWN EARLIER ATTEMPT
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 * An earlier trap-reporting design supplies the names and behavior: eight vectors, a
 * persistent latch, a boot report, a policy switch, and console commands that fire traps
 * on demand. Its file and function names are retained here as one coherent module.
 *   an earlier AK attempt in this project (2026-08-02) -- which established the AK
 *     register set worth capturing and the write-order that makes a record trustworthy.
 *     It was picked up long after it was written, by which time the NORA rename had moved
 *     the reset API it called.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED IN THE PORT, AND WHY
 * ---------------------------------
 *   - The latch lives in the hal_noinit_ram block (src/noinit_ram_layout.h) instead of
 *     raw __attribute__((persistent)) locals. On this repo's AK that HAL already exists and
 *     already owns the surviving-RAM question: it is the only thing that knows the range is
 *     KEEP + NOLOAD in the linker script and out of the stack's reach. The attribute alone
 *     does NOT protect a range -- it is a section request, and a request the best-fit
 *     allocator is free to place the automatic stack on top of. CK still uses the raw
 *     attribute because CK has no such HAL, not because the attribute is sufficient.
 *   - No policy switch. CK needs one because two boards want opposite behaviour
 *     (Curiosity Nano with no reset button wants latch-and-reset, DM330030 with a debugger
 *     attached wants spin). This repo builds one board family and the AK original already
 *     chose latch-and-reset, for the same reason the Nano does: the console is the only
 *     observer. A switch with one value is a switch nobody sets correctly the day a second
 *     value appears -- it can be added then, with a board that wants it.
 *
 * TWO HALVES, BECAUSE A TRAP CANNOT PRINT
 * ---------------------------------------
 * 1. The handlers run in trap context, where the machine state is by definition suspect.
 *    They do the least they can: latch which trap fired and the raw AK fault registers,
 *    then RESET. They do NOT print -- printing means calling the UART with an unknown
 *    stack, and a printf that faults inside a trap handler loses the evidence entirely.
 *    This repo's main.c had exactly that until this change: an _AddressErrorTrap that
 *    printf'd and then spun forever.
 * 2. app_traps_report_previous() runs from ordinary code after the console is up, reads the
 *    latch, prints it, and consumes it.
 *
 * It composes with the reset-cause report the boot banner already prints: a trap-induced
 * reset appears as SWR in the reset cause AND as a record here, which together say "the
 * firmware trapped and restarted" instead of a bare SWR that looks like someone typed *sr.
