// PUBLISH ORDER is the one thing to preserve if this file is edited. A trap can be
// followed by anything, including another trap, so the record is written in this order:
//
//     magic = 0            the record is now explicitly absent
//     ...payload...        every captured register
//     magic = MAGIC        the record is complete
//
// An interruption anywhere before that last store leaves the magic at zero, so the next
// boot sees "no record" -- never a plausible half-written one. Measured on the sibling
// resident pipe with the order reversed: a write interrupted after its check word came
// back VALID, carrying garbage. A check alone does not save you; it mismatches by luck.
