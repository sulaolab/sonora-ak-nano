     * WHY, because "the newer part offers fewer options" is the natural suspicion and it
     * is not what is happening -- dsPIC33AK's Timer1 has NO clock selection of its own
     * to offer. Measured against DS70005591C section 26:
     *
     *   Table 26-1 (Timer Summary)  clock source = Standard Speed Peripheral Clock
     *                              (System Clock/2)
     *   Table 26-2 (TCS)           1 = external clock source, 0 = peripheral clock.
     *                              TWO values, no FRC among them
     *   Figure 26-1 (block dgm)    the mux has two inputs: TxCK (PPS) and System Clock
     *   T1CON bit map              15:8 = ON/SIDL/TMWDIS/TMWIP/PRWIP,
     *                              7:0 = TGATE/TCKPS[1:0]/TSYNC/TCS.
     *                              Bits 9:8 are not documented -- there is no TECS
     *
     * Some timer variants do have a real TECS selector, but this dsPIC33AK timer does
     * not. AK's DFP header declares `uint8_t TECS:2` anyway, and its ATDF
     * value group holds a single entry (0x0 = T1CK) -- a 2-bit field with one documented
     * value, absent from the data sheet's own register map, is a header leftover. DO NOT
     * implement this against that bitfield.
     *
     * A caller who needs an FRC-clocked tick on AK has two routes, and neither is a
     * tick-timer operation:
     *
     *  1. Re-clock the part. nora_clock_switch_source(NORA_CLOCK_SOURCE_FRC,
     *     NORA_CLOCK_FRC_HZ) makes the peripheral clock 4 MHz, and Timer1 then runs off
     *     FRC through System Clock/2 -- pass timer_clk_hz = NORA_CLOCK_FRC_HZ / 2, not
     *     NORA_CLOCK_FRC_HZ. This is a whole-chip decision, which is why
     *     nora_tick_timer_init() must not make it.
     *  2. Emit FRC on a pin from a CLKGEN and return it to TxCK through PPS (TCS = 1).
     *     Costs a pin and a board trace, so it is a board decision. NOT VERIFIED: which
     *     CLKGEN can emit FRC, and which TxCK-capable RP can receive it, are unchecked.
     *
     * There is NO CLKGEN in Timer1's own path -- route 1 works by moving the system
     * clock, not by aiming a generator at the timer. (Claiming otherwise was a wrong
     * answer given once during this investigation.)
