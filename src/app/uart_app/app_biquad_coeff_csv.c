 * computes for the rest of the transaction.

 * recognition and the first idle-refresh that is skipped because of it happen
 * inside the SAME app_uart_process() pass (start_from_header() runs synchronously
 * off the trailing byte of the header line, before the task's refresh call for
 * that pass), so the value in place when a transaction starts is whatever the
 * PREVIOUS pass left here -- at most one main-loop iteration old, not "however
 * long BEGIN recognition took under load".
 *
 * That one-iteration residual is conservative, not a remaining blind spot: it
 * can only attribute a fault from just before the transfer TO the transfer (a
 * false-positive reject of what was otherwise a clean transfer), because a
 * stale-but-not-yet-refreshed baseline is always <= the fault count at the
