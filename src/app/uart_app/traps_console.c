 * traps_console.c -- common console module 'x': exceptions (traps).
 *
 *   ?xl  last trap and the count since power-on
 *   *xa  force an address error    *xm  force a math error
 *   *xs  force a stack overflow
 *
 * This module preserves established trap-console file, module and command names. What this
 * target has to answer differently is only WHERE the two "genuinely wrong" values come from
 * -- see THE TWO TARGETS below.
 *
 * WHY 'x' AND NOT 't'
 * -------------------
 * 't' is this repo's transport module (*tr restart, *tf frame-slip). CK made the same
 * choice for the same reason. One letter meaning two things across two projects is how muscle
 * memory turns into a wrong command on hardware.
 *
 * WHY THE FORCED TRAPS EXIST AT ALL
 * ---------------------------------
 * Trap handlers only run when something has already gone wrong, which makes them exactly
 * the kind of code that rots unnoticed: without a way to fire one, "the trap latch works"
 * is an assumption. Each of these is genuinely undefined behaviour by design -- that is the
 * point -- so they are shaped to defeat the optimiser (volatile operands it cannot fold,
 * values it cannot prove) rather than relying on it being naive. Guarded by
 * APP_TRAP_TEST_CMDS so a shipping image need not carry them.
 *
 * THE TWO TARGETS, AND WHY THERE IS NO BOARD SEAM HERE
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * CK asks the linked board for these two values (board_trap_bad_addr(),
 * board_trap_stack_beyond_limit()) because it builds two boards from one tree. This repo
 * builds one board family, and neither value is a board fact in it:
 *
 *   the bad address is a DEVICE fact, and it is already stated once, in
 *   src/noinit_ram_config.h -- that block sits at the top of data RAM by construction, so
 *   the first address with nothing behind it is its end. Deriving it from there instead of
 *   writing 0x14000 again means the two cannot drift; the _Static_assert below still pins
 *   the expected value per device, so moving the block away from the top of RAM fails the
 *   build here rather than silently pointing this test at ordinary RAM.
 *
 *   the stack limit is a CONFIGURATION fact, not even a device one -- SPLIM differs per
 *   configuration (measured: 0x13DC0 in the AK512 serial-update build, 0x7F20 on AK128,
 *   each being that link's stack top minus its --stackguard). So it is read from SPLIM at
 *   run time, which is the register the hardware itself compares against. A constant here
 *   would have to be re-measured after every link that moves the stack.
 *
 * A board seam can be introduced the day a second board wants different answers, exactly
 * as CK's was; there is nothing above this line to change when it does.

 * ---- Stack high-water measurement:  *xw  arm,  ?xw  read -----------------------------
 *
 * WHY HERE, in module 'x', and not in a file of its own: it answers the same question as the
 * trap latch above -- did the stack survive -- and this module already owns SPLIM for the
 * same reason (it is a per-configuration fact, read from the register rather than written
 * down). A new translation unit would also mean editing every configuration in
 * nbproject/configurations.xml, which is a worse trade for a measurement.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS. The stack grows UP on this core and SPLIM is the top the hardware enforces,
 * so everything between the console's own stack pointer and SPLIM is memory that no live
 * frame owns. *xw paints that region with a pattern; ?xw scans DOWN from SPLIM for the first
 * word that is no longer the pattern. That word is the deepest point ANY context reached
 * since the arm -- interrupt frames, and nested interrupt frames, included. Nesting is
 * exactly what a rate-monotonic priority assignment introduces, so this is the instrument
 * for it.
 *
 * Painting while interrupts are live is safe on this core: an ISR that preempts the fill has
 * returned before the fill resumes, so the only frames the loop ever writes over are dead
 * ones. There is no second context to race with.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT TELL YOU. If the stack really overflows, the report says the peak sits at
 * SPLIM -- the demand exceeded the region -- and never by how much, because the STACK ERROR
 * trap stops the machine at the limit. Measuring the DEMAND needs a region big enough to hold
 * it, which is why the flash-coefficient build is where that number comes from.
 * recorded validation section 17.

 * Stack error: push W15 past SPLIM.
 *
 * SPLIM is what the hardware compares the stack pointer against, so writing a stack
 * pointer beyond it is the DEFINITION of the fault rather than an attempt to provoke one.
 * (CK's first attempt recursed instead and did not trap -- either the optimiser folded the
 * recursion or the frames never reached the limit. Rather than find out which, drive W15.)
 *
 * noreturn + noinline so the compiler neither inlines this into the caller's frame nor
 * assumes execution continues afterwards.
 *
 * The margin is small on purpose. Everything above SPLIM is the linker's stack guard and
 * then the surviving block, so the trap's own context save has real memory to land in --
 * and since app_traps_record_and_reset() publishes the record AFTER that save, a save that
 * reaches into the block cannot destroy the evidence.
 *
 * WHAT THIS PROVES IS NOT SETTLED YET. On CK this path does not produce a software
 * _StackError report at all: W15 is already past SPLIM, so the handler's own push
 * overflows too, the core takes a trap within a trap and resets with RCON.TRAPR set. AK has
 * no TRAPR bit and a General trap this family may take instead, so which of "a STACK ERROR
 * record" and "a bare reset" appears here is a hardware question -- and it is one of the
 * two things the first hardware run of this feature is for. Either outcome is informative:

/* ============================================================================
 * *xr -- does the dsPIC33A really bank RCOUNT per IPL?   (investigation #3.25)
 * ============================================================================
 * A SILICON QUESTION, ASKED BECAUSE THE DOCUMENTS DISAGREE
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 * DS70005591C 4.3.9 lists RCOUNT among the registers each of the seven per-IPL
 * hardware contexts owns, and XC-DSC agrees with it in practice: the dsPIC33A
 * interrupt attribute was "made hardware register context aware" (XCDSC-127,
 * v3.30) and the v3.31.01 ELF of this very image contains ZERO RCOUNT saves in
 * ISRs that run REPEAT loops. DS 4.3.15.1.2 says the opposite in prose: an ISR
 * that executes its own REPEAT must stack RCOUNT and unstack it before RETFIE,
 * and an interrupted REPEAT can be terminated early by clearing RCOUNT inside
 * the ISR -- both of which only mean anything if RCOUNT is SHARED.
 *
 * Two documents, one of them wrong, and the answer decides whether the
 * STACK ERROR at _fir_ring_q31_ymod_yonly_block+0x54 has a mechanism at all.
 * No amount of further reading settles it. The silicon can.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES IN THE ASRC IMAGE AND NOT IN A BENCH BUILD
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 * A separate bench would be a different translation-unit set, possibly with
 * different compiler options and different interrupt attributes -- i.e. it
 * could answer the question for a build that is not the one that traps. This is
 * compiled into the image under test, behind APP_RCOUNT_PROBE, and it runs only
 * when a human types *xr.
 *
 * TWO SEPARATE INTERRUPT SOURCES, NOT ONE RE-PRIORITISED
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * QEI2 is the outer (lower priority), QEI1 the inner (higher). Raising one
 * source priority mid-test to make it interrupt itself would drag the live
 * IPC-update question -- the thing under investigation elsewhere in this report
 * -- into the measurement. Two sources keep them apart.
 *
 * QEI1/QEI2 because the peripheral exists on this device (ATDF vectors 136 and
 * 137) and NOTHING in this firmware uses it: no QEI clock, no ISR, no PPS
 * route. So the vectors can be driven purely by writing IFS, which needs no
 * peripheral, no pin and no clock, and is instantaneous -- unlike the spare
 * timer this probe was first designed around, which needed a peripheral this
 * image does not have free (CCP1 and CCP9 are the high-res timer, and the
 * input-capture HAL claims CCP1-CCP9).
 *
 * THE BYTE WRITE, AND WHY IT IS A BYTE
 * ------------------------------------
 * IFS4<8..15> is QEI1-4IF, BISS1EIF, BISS1IF, CRCIF, ICDIF -- eight flags, not
 * one of them used by this firmware. So byte 1 of IFS4 can be written whole, as
 * a single instruction, without a read-modify-write and without disturbing
 * anything live. That matters twice: the trigger inside the outer REPEAT loop
 * MUST be one instruction, and a whole-WORD store to IFS4 would have rewritten
 * CCP9IF -- the high-res timer, which this probe uses to measure. IEC4 byte 1
 * is the same eight bits, which is what lets the enables be set and cleared by
 * constant byte writes (a bitfield write would be a read-modify-write of a word
 * shared with CCP9IE -- see the fleet rule in memory
 * dfp-bit-alias-atomic-only-if-constant).
 *
 * PROBE-EXCLUSIVE CONTEXTS -- IPL 5 AND 6, NOT 3 AND 4
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * The sentinel below is only evidence if NOTHING ELSE can write the context it
 * is stored in. The fault lives at IPL3/IPL4, so the obvious choice would be to
 * probe there -- but a single ordinary IPL4 DMA ISR running one REPEAT during
 * the test overwrites the sentinel, and "the sentinel was gone" then means
 * either "RCOUNT is shared" or "a DMA ISR stepped on it". Those are opposite
 * conclusions, and the wrong one is the one we would act on.
 *
 * So the probe owns two contexts NOTHING in this firmware uses: IPL5 and IPL6.
 * The question -- is RCOUNT banked per IPL -- is the same for any two distinct
 * IPLs, and DS 4.3.9 describes one mechanism for all seven contexts. The
 * transport is stopped first as well, and IEC2/IEC3/IFS2/IFS3 are printed
 * before and after so the isolation is MEASURED and not assumed. That second
 * belt matters here specifically: 19.8.1 records an unconfirmed suspicion that
 * audio_transport_stop() may leave leg A TDM DMA armed, and IPL5/6 is immune to
 * it either way.
 *
 * WHAT EACH STAGE PROVES
 * ----------------------
 *   A  poison + separation. The inner ISR writes 0xA5A5 into RCOUNT and reads
 *      it straight back (does the write take at all?). The base context has
 *      0x5A5A in it, written before the trigger; after the ISR returns, base
 *      still reading 0x5A5A means the two contexts are distinct. Then the inner
 *      is fired a second time and reads RCOUNT FIRST: 0xA5A5 means its own
 *      context survived a return to base and a re-entry -- banked. 0x5A5A means
 *      it is looking at the base register -- shared.
 *   B  mid-REPEAT capture. The outer starts a 20,000-iteration REPEAT whose
 *      repeated instruction fires the inner. The inner captures RCOUNT as its
 *      first instruction: 0xA5A5 = the outer live loop counter is invisible to
 *      it (banked); a large value near 20,000 = it is reading the outer
 *      countdown (shared), which would be the mechanism the report is hunting.
 *   C  early termination, which adjudicates the DS prose directly. Same loop,
 *      but the inner writes RCOUNT = 0. If the outer loop still runs to
 *      completion (elapsed ~= stage B) the DS Early-Termination clause cannot
 *      be describing this core. If it ends immediately (elapsed << B) then
 *      RCOUNT is shared or aliased and the clause is literal.
 *
 * NO CLEAN-UP AMBITION. State is left as the probe leaves it and the report
 * says to power-cycle or *sr afterwards: a diagnostic that also tries to
 * restore a half-stopped audio transport is a diagnostic with a second thing
 * that can go wrong.
