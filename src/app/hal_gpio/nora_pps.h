/*
 * nora_pps.h
 * ---------------
 * Peripheral Pin Select (PPS) routing -- the companion to the NORA GPIO HAL
 * (same hal_gpio family). NORA GPIO owns the pin's ELECTRICAL attributes
 * (TRIS/LAT/ANSEL/pull/OD); this module owns the SIGNAL ROUTING (which RP pin a
 * peripheral input reads from / a peripheral output drives), i.e. the RPINRx
 * (input-select) and RPORx (output _RPnnR) registers.
 *
 * Why a thin PPS layer:
 *   Board code otherwise writes device SFRs directly -- e.g.
 *       _RP90R = 29;        // SCK2 out on RP90 (what is 29?)
 *       _SS2R  = 29;        // SS2 in from RP29
 *   which leaks the RPORx/RPINRx map and the raw function codes into the board.
 *   These two calls hide that:
 *       nora_pps_route_output(NORA_PPS_OUTPUT_SCK2, 90u);
 *       nora_pps_route_input (NORA_PPS_INPUT_SS2,   29u);
 *   leaving only "which signal" + "which RP" at the call site.
 *
 * Processor adaptation: the implementation keys off the XC SFR/constant macros
 * (_RPOUT_xxx, _RPnnR, the input-select registers) with #ifdef, so a peripheral
 * or RP that the selected device does not define is simply unroutable (the call
 * returns false) -- no per-device part-number conditionals here.
 *
 * Coverage: both route_* accept any remappable pin the selected device defines --
 * PHYSICAL (RP1..RP128) or VIRTUAL (RPV0..RPV15 == RP129..RP144, see below). RP is
 * a nora_gpio_rp_t supplied by the board pin map; its numeric range and encoding
 * are processor-specific. Every case is #ifdef-guarded on its _RPnnR, so an RP the
 * selected device does not define is rejected before any register write.
 *
 * This paragraph used to say the RPV outputs were "intentionally NOT routable
 * here -- if they are ever needed, add a separate virtual-output API rather than
 * overloading this GPIO-typed one." That call is reversed, and the reason is that
 * the CK HAL took the other road and the other road works: an RPV endpoint has an
 * _RPnnR that takes the same 6-bit function code as any pad, so routing to one is
 * the SAME operation, and CK's TDM frame-sync generator uses RPV0 to hand a SPI
 * FRMSYNC marker to a CLC input through exactly this call. A separate API would
 * have been a second copy of the RPORx map -- the one thing this file exists to
 * keep in a single place. What "GPIO-typed" really costs is not routing but
 * CONFIGURATION, and that is fenced off where it belongs: nora_gpio_rp_config_*
 * rejects anything above RP_MAX, so nora_pinmux_route_*() (which configures first)
 * refuses an RPV, while nora_pps_route_*() (which does not) accepts it.
 *
 * The peripheral-SIGNAL enums are the AK/CK UNION, not a list of what this
 * codebase happens to call today: for every peripheral family the enums name,
 * they carry every instance either family's device headers define (UART1-3,
 * SPI1-4, CLC1-10, PWM1-8 H/L as available, PWM event A-D, CMP1-8, REFO1/2,
 * REFI1, INT1-4, CAN1/2, ICM1-9). They still do NOT cover every PPS-capable
 * peripheral the silicon has -- OCM, SENT, QEI, BISS and PTGTRG are absent as
 * whole families. Add a new signal by extending the enum and the matching case
 * in nora_pps_dspic33ak.c -- and add it to the CK header too, because the two
 * enums are kept textually identical on purpose. Routing a signal absent on the
 * selected device returns false.
 *
 * Pairing with hal_gpio: PPS routing does NOT configure the pin's direction or
 * analog/digital select. Configure the pin first (nora_gpio_rp_config_*),
 * then route the signal. Order is glitch-aware for outputs: seed the GPIO output
 * (LAT/TRIS) before the PPS output starts driving it.
 *
 * IOLOCK: each route_* call brackets its own write with unlock()/lock() (IOLOCK
 * resets to 0 = unlocked, so this only adds protection). unlock()/lock() are also
 * exposed for code that writes PPS SFRs directly (e.g. the PWM driver) or wants a
 * single window around a batch of direct writes.

/*
 * VIRTUAL RP PINS (RPV0..RPV15 == RP129..RP144).
 *
 * These are remappable PPS endpoints with NO PAD: a peripheral output routed to one
 * is readable by another peripheral's PPS input and by nothing else. They are how a
 * signal is fed from one on-chip block to another without spending a package pin.
 *
 * They are deliberately NOT nora_gpio_pin_t values: they have no TRIS, no LAT and no
 * ANSEL, so nothing in the GPIO half of this family applies to them. They are
 * nora_gpio_rp_t values, because routing is the one thing they DO have -- which is why
 * the two route_*() calls take them and the gpio config calls (and therefore
 * nora_pinmux_route_*()) do not.
 *
 * Availability is per device (checked via _RP129R etc. in the .c); a virtual pin the
 * device does not define is simply unroutable and the call returns false. On
 * dsPIC33AK128MC106 that is ALL of them -- its output registers stop at _RP80R.
 *
 * HOW MANY IS A SILICON COUNT, like NORA_GPIO_RP_MAX. This family has sixteen
 * (RP129..RP144 on dsPIC33AK512MPS512). The numeric values behind these names
 * are device-specific -- but the NAMES are stable, and code that stays within
 * RPV0..RPV5 compiles and routes on both families. Beyond RPV5 is AK-only.
