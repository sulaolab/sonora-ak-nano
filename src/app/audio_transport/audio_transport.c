 *   - Dropping leg A 96k -> 48k leaves it ADC-only, likewise.
 *
 * Letting the role follow the rate would silently turn a one-way A->B image into a
 * full-duplex one mid-run, which the ASRC route is not set up to agree with. The

//===========================================================
// Engine-wide DSP load line ("DSPload").
//
// WHAT IT REPORTS
//   self    = leg A exclusive CPU time + leg B exclusive CPU time, over a FIXED measurement
//             window. This is the DSP load: the share of the CPU the audio legs actually
//             consumed. Exclusive means that when a higher-priority vector preempts a leg, the
//             preemptor's execution is charged to itself, not to the leg it interrupted.
//   stolen  = time a leg was held off by an instrumented higher-priority ISR. What the old
//             wall-time reading silently folded into the leg's own total is now its own number.
//   demand  = self + stolen: the CPU time the legs wanted, including what they waited for.
//
// A_self / B_self / self / stolen / demand are per-window MEANS over the windows closed since the
// previous print -- window-length independent, and the honest "what did it cost" figure.
// max_self / max_demand are the single worst window in that same interval; THAT is what the
// window length buys, because shortening the window pushes the peak toward the per-block truth.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT
// A deadline instrument. The window is a fixed time, deliberately unrelated to the block period
// (10 ms is ~30 blocks at 333 us), so one late block is averaged away. Deadline margin lives in
// the per-leg TDM lines above (response time, preemption included) and in the real-harm counters
// miss / starve / ovf / udf / drop. Do not read margin from this line.
//
// WHY THE PREDECESSOR WAS REPLACED (2026-08-26)
// The TDMsum line printed the peak TIME UNION during which any TDM RX ISR was executing, over a
// window equal to the shortest running leg's block deadline and phase-locked to that leg's block
// boundary. Wall time is response time: under the rate-monotonic priority map
// (APP_ASRC_RATE_MONOTONIC_ISR, on by default) the demoted leg absorbs the promoted leg's whole
// execution, so the "union" over-counted by exactly the overlap it existed to remove -- 48k/44.1k
// read 100.0 % where the legs' own time summed to about 72.6 %. Figures labelled TDMsum elsewhere
// in this tree came from that instrument and are NOT comparable with these.
//
// NOT CLAMPED. A peak above the window is printed as-is with over= beside it; a load past the
// budget is the finding, and rounding it to "100.0%" is what made the old line unusable.
//
// The window length is a build default (APP_DSPLOAD_WINDOW_US, 10 ms) overridable live from the
// console, so 1 ms / 10 ms / 100 ms are comparable within one image. Nothing here hardcodes it.
//===========================================================

//===========================================================
// PRINTF-CLICK mechanism isolation -- research instrument (2026-09-17)
//
// WHY IT IS HERE. The periodic report is the stimulus under investigation, so every instrument
// that answers "what about the report breaks audio" has to be readable WITHOUT adding a byte to
// the report. Everything below is therefore console-query only ("?tj"), and the stimulus itself
// is switchable at runtime ("*tm") so one flashed image can present all five conditions to a
// listener without a re-flash.
//
// WHAT THE EXISTING INSTRUMENTS COULD NOT SEE. resp= is the block ISR's ENTRY-to-EXIT time, so a
// delayed ENTRY is structurally invisible to it: the ISR can start 20 us late, run its normal
// 650.6 us, and report an unchanged resp with margin +16.0 us while the audio timeline has
// already slipped. miss= only counts a HALF+DONE conflict (a whole block late), so it is blind
// to the same thing. Entry-to-entry interval is the missing half of the deadline picture, and it
// is bucketed here by WHETHER A REPORT WAS IN PROGRESS, which makes the correlation direct
// instead of inferred from a threshold nobody has calibrated yet.
//
// THE FIVE STIMULUS MODES are layers of the real report, not imitations of it:
//   OFF          nothing runs (the period gate still fires)
//   NORMAL       the report exactly as shipped
//   SNAP_ONLY    only take_window() + prof_get() -- the two INTERRUPT-BLIND windows the report
//                opens before it formats anything. Nothing is printed and no UART is touched.
//   STALL_ONLY   only a foreground busy-wait as long as a measured NORMAL report, interrupts
//                left enabled, no formatter, no UART.
//   FORMAT_ONLY  the whole NORMAL path with write() muted: same formatter, same call sequence,
//                bytes discarded, UART peripheral untouched. NOTE it is a superset of SNAP_ONLY
//                -- see the caveat below.
//   TX_ONLY      a fixed pre-built string of the same length as a report, pushed through the
//                same blocking write() path, with no formatter and no snapshot.
//
// ATTRIBUTION CAVEAT, stated so a reader cannot draw the wrong conclusion from the matrix:
// FORMAT_ONLY necessarily runs the snapshot first (the formatter needs values). So "FORMAT_ONLY
// clicks" does NOT implicate the formatter until SNAP_ONLY has been shown NOT to click. That is
// exactly why SNAP_ONLY exists and why it is not in the original four-test plan.

 * WHY IT EXISTS, and why it is a switch rather than a fix. The RM priority assignment
 * (asrc_audio_path_apply_isr_priorities(), added by a9f8cc9) states as its contract that it runs
 * "while the transport is stopped ... before any domain starts", and is "deliberately NOT
 * dynamic". The ASRC layer registers it behind reset_stream_state(), and the fast path below
 * calls reset_stream_state() with the transport DELIBERATELY still running -- so the one callback
 * is reached down two paths that make OPPOSITE claims about whether anything is streaming. That
 * is a control-flow contradiction, not a stale comment: measured on hardware, the fast path does
 * re-run the assignment, and it does so with both legs' ISRs live. It is NOT self-preemption --
 * the assignment runs at task level and so cannot execute while an ISR is in flight, and a source
 * at the same IPL as the running level does not preempt it either -- but it does update the two
 * legs' IPC in SEQUENCE, so between the two writes the priority map is neither the old one nor the
 * new one, and it resets ASRC stream state while the producers of that state keep firing. Note the
 * DMA HAL's ordinary reconfigure path masks the IRQ before rewriting a live channel for exactly
 * this class of reason; the RM priority setter does not.
 *
 * Setting this to 0 restores a9f8cc9's own precondition WITHOUT touching one line of the RM logic,
 * which is what makes the resulting sweep a clean discriminator:
 *   STACK ERROR = 0 here  -> the fault needs the live reconfigure, and the fix belongs at that seam
 *   STACK ERROR persists  -> live IPC change is not the mechanism; look elsewhere
 * The cost of 0 is only switch TIME (leg B stops paying for its own clock domain); it is not a
 * capability change, which is why it is safe to ship either value while the question is open.
