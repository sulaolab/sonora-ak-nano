//===========================================================
// nora_noinit_ram.{c,h} -- reserve ONE block of RAM that
//   (1) sits at an address YOU choose, so two separately-linked images
//       (the resident bootloader and the application) can both reach the same
//       bytes, and
//   (2) the C runtime start-up does NOT initialize, so those bytes keep their
//       values across a reset.
//
// That is the whole job. This HAL hands you a lump of RAM and gets out of the way.
//
// WHAT THIS HAL DOES NOT DO -- on purpose
//   It does not know, and does not want to know, what you put in there. No magic
//   number, no version field, no length, no checksum, no "is it valid" question.
//   Those belong to whatever you build INSIDE the block: share a struct between the
//   bootloader and the application, and let that struct carry whatever framing your
//   protocol needs. The HAL reserves the pipe; you decide what flows through it.
//
//   Keeping the payload out of the HAL is what lets the same reservation serve a
//   command mailbox, a duplicate sentinel, and a register trace that a stackless
//   pre-CRT assembly stub writes by hard-coded field offset. A HAL that imposed its
//   own header would fight every one of those.
//
// NAME vs ATTRIBUTE -- read this before grepping.
//   The generic embedded term for "RAM the C runtime deliberately does not
//   initialize" is a .noinit section, and that is what this module is named after.
//   On XC-DSC the equivalent spelling is __attribute__((persistent)); there is no
//   section literally called .noinit here. So: grep for "persistent", not ".noinit".
//   The name says WHAT the memory is; the attribute is this toolchain's way of asking.
//
// WHY "_ram" IS IN THE NAME
//   Because losing it on power-off is correct behaviour, not a bug. This is
//   volatile-cell persistence, NOT non-volatile storage. The cells keep their bits
//   across a warm reset (MCLR / software / watchdog) because they never lost power;
//   after a real power cycle their contents are INDETERMINATE. Names like "retained"
//   or "backup" are used elsewhere for battery-backed domains that DO survive a power
//   cycle (e.g. STM32 backup SRAM). This is not that.
//
//   So: if your container must be able to tell "this is genuine data" from "these are
//   whatever bits the cells came up with", your container needs its own validity check
//   (a magic word and a checksum is the usual answer, and the reset cause from
//   hal_reset tells you when to distrust the block entirely). The HAL will not do it
//   for you, because only you know what the data means.
//
// PORTABILITY
//   __attribute__((persistent)) and the crt0 behaviour are identical on the
//   dsPIC33AK512MPS512 (AK512) and dsPIC33AK128MC106 (AK128).
//===========================================================
//
// HOW TO USE IT
//
//   1. Reserve the range in the linker script (see 2 below and the doc -- this is the
//      part the HAL cannot do for you), then say so:
//
//        #define NORA_NOINIT_RAM_LINKER_RESERVED 1
//
//   2. Say where the block goes and how big it is (both required):
//
//        #define NORA_NOINIT_RAM_ADDRESS  0x00004050
//        #define NORA_NOINIT_RAM_SIZE     64
//
//   3. Describe the contents in a header BOTH images include, and overlay it:
//
//        typedef struct { uint32_t magic; uint32_t request; ... } my_pipe_t;
//        NORA_NOINIT_RAM_FITS( my_pipe_t );          // compile-time size check
//        volatile my_pipe_t *p = NORA_NOINIT_RAM_AS( my_pipe_t );
//
//      Both images must agree on the address, the size, and the struct. Nothing here
//      can check that the OTHER image agrees -- that is what sharing one header for
//      the struct and one for the two #defines is for.
//
