 * Re-source the CCP/SCCP capture time base (CLKGEN13) from PLL2 <- REFI1, so the
 * clock the ASRC measures sample rates WITH comes from the same crystal as the
 * sample rates it measures. CLKGEN13 is what CCPxCON1.CLKSEL=1 selects, so this
 * moves the capture time base and nothing else -- no other peripheral changes
 * clock, and SysCLK stays on PLL1 <- FRC.
 *
 * What this buys: absolute fs accuracy. It does NOT change servo behaviour, which
 * is driven by the FIFO fill error and is immune to time-base error either way.
 *
 * The reference is specifically codec-A's XTALout on RP16 (Rev.4 PCB): a FIXED
 * 12.288 MHz that does NOT follow fs. That is what makes a fixed PLL2 input_hz
 * sound, and it is measured -- a 48k -> 16k codec-A rate change moved the codec's
 * BCLK_DIV while the reported rate stayed exact. This path therefore routes RP16
 * explicitly instead of using the per-board REFI1 router, and builds whose REFI1
 * carries something else (legacy RP75, USB MCLK on RP26, AK128's RP33) are refused
 * in resolved_board_config.h.
 *
 * Call application-side, AFTER WM8904-A is up (REFI1 needs its clock present). A
 * failure must be reported and the start stopped, not worked around.
 *
 * Position relative to the CCP, precisely: BEFORE THE FIRST ARM. On a restart or
 * rate change the CCP is already running (arming is one-shot), so this call moves
 * CLKGEN13 UNDER A LIVE CAPTURE. That is safe only because the transport is muted
 * across the window and the subsequent reset_stream_state() -> ccpdet_reset()
 * discards the captures that straddled the switch -- if that stops being true, this
 * call needs a stop/re-arm around it instead. See the call site in
 * audio_transport.c.
 *
 * Known and deliberately unexercised: PLL2's reference is produced by the same
 * codec whose rates are being measured, so PLL2 loses its input if codec-A's
 * clock output stops entirely (a full power-down -- NOT a rate change, which is
 * measured safe).
