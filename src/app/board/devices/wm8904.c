/*
 * Decided 2026-08-19 during the ROM-diet work.
 *
 * These three are deliberately NOT project-level macros. Putting them in
 * configurations.xml would let one configuration diverge from another, and a
 * codec bring-up that talks and self-checks differently on AK128 than on AK512
 * is a debugging trap worth more than the bytes it saves. The driver fixes them
 * here instead, so every configuration -- AK128 serial update, AK512 Classic,
 * AK512 ASRC -- builds the same behaviour.
 *
 * A -D of any of the three from the build config is a build ERROR, not a silent
 * override: to measure an alternative, edit the three lines below (and put them
 * back). The per-setting commentary further down says what each one removes.

/*
 * HIGH RATES: WHAT THE HARDWARE SAYS, AND WHAT THIS DRIVER IMPLEMENTS.
 *
 * Hardware (datasheet): at fs >= 88.2 kHz the WM8904 cannot run its ADC and DAC
 * simultaneously.  That is a property of the part, stated as >= 88.2 kHz because
 * that is where the datasheet draws the line.
 *
 * Implemented here: the rate table below offers 8, 11.025, 12, 16, 22.05, 24, 32,
 * 44.1, 48 and 96 kHz.  THERE IS NO 88.2 kHz ROW -- 96 kHz is the only rate in the
 * menu on the far side of that hardware boundary, so it is the only rate the
 * ADC+DAC rule can ever refuse.
 *
 * 96 kHz needs no dedicated register sequence: it is a table row like the others.
 * The register facts that used to live in dedicated constants -- SAMPLE_RATE still
 * selects the 48 kHz setting, CLK_SYS_RATE selects SYSCLK/fs = 128, BCLK_DIV
 * = 00010, LRCLK_RATE = 040h -- are simply that row's columns.  It is offered on a
 * 2-slot frame only (its TDM8 columns are WM8904_I2S_RATE_UNSUPPORTED).  The one
 * thing the table cannot express is enforced in wm8904_init_role(): no
 * simultaneous ADC + DAC at or above the hardware boundary.
 */

// Configurable sample rate -- FULL standard menu, TDM8 path (8 slots x 32 bit): BCLK = fs x 256,
// LRCLK_RATE = 256. So per fs: CLK_SYS_RATE = SYSCLK/fs, BCLK_DIV = SYSCLK/(fs x 256).
//   (Phase B) 48k FAMILY (8/12/16/24/32/48k): FLL-less, SYSCLK = MCLK = 12.288 MHz.
