/*
 * Configuration is one path: the rate table (whose rows are 8, 11.025, 12, 16,
 * 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1, 48 and 96 kHz -- 96 kHz is a row like any other, and there
 * is no 88.2 kHz row) plus an explicit wm8904_role_t. Rate and converter role are
 * independent axes, which is what makes a rate-only change -- e.g. a runtime
 * 96k -> 48k switch on leg B -- expressible at all.
 *
 * This replaced a split of wm8904_config() (48 kHz family) plus dedicated
 * wm8904_config_96k_{adc,dac}_only() / wm8904_init_96k_* entry points. That split
 * was carried alongside this path behind a temporary WM8904_USE_UNIFIED_CONFIG
 * A/B switch until the unified path had been hardware-verified on every
 * configuration that exercises the codec (Classic 96 K, ASRC 96 kHz A->B,
 * ASRC 48 kHz BIDIR, and the runtime `*ar 1 8` rate change), then deleted.
 * recorded validation records the evidence, the two
 * silent-revert defects the split caused, and the one behavioural difference
 * unification introduces (§7).

 * Declick research one-shot restart-strategy bitmask.

 * audio_transport_restart_declick()); the codec (re)configure path reads it while it
 * runs. 0 == baseline == the unchanged shipping behavior, so shipping and the auto-
 * recovery restart path (which never arm a mask) are unaffected. Bits may be OR-combined.

 * SHUTDOWN discharge policy (decided by measurement -- see recorded validation):

 * Converter role -- which halves of the codec are powered and clocked.
 *
 * This is an axis of its own, independent of the sample rate.  It reads as a
 * "96 kHz thing" only because the hardware FORCES a choice at fs >= 88.2 kHz (the
 * WM8904 cannot run its ADC and DAC simultaneously there), and 96 kHz is the only
 * rate this driver offers on that side of the boundary.  ADC-only / DAC-only are
 * equally meaningful at any rate, though -- e.g. a
 * one-way path that has no use for the unused converter's power or noise.
 *
 * Treating role and rate as one axis is what previously required separate
 * wm8904_init_96k_* entry points, and why a rate-only change could not be
 * expressed without also re-deciding the role.
