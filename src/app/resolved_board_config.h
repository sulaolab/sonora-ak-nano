 * USB source's MCLK, AK128 routes RP33, and the legacy RP75 route is documented as
 * BCLK -- which, if it really is BCLK, moves with BCLK_DIV and would silently
 * invalidate PLL2's fixed input_hz on every rate change.
 *
 * The flag's own consumer routes RP16 explicitly rather than sharing the PWM path's
 * board-aware router, so these refusals and that route must agree. Refuse rather than
 * measure a crystal-clocked rate against an unknown ruler. */
