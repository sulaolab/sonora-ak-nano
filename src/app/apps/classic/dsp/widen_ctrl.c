/*
 * Fast path for the current demo setting:
 *   side_hpf_hz = 0, delay enabled, all-pass enabled.
 *
 * Same audio path as widen_process() and the same output bit pattern; what it
 * removes is the overhead the audio math was buried in.  Measured on the linked
 * ELF (conf dsPIC33AK512, -O3 -ffast-math, APP_BLOCK_FRAMES = 32), the previous
 * version of this loop was 40 instructions per sample of which only 12 were
 * audio: 13 went to integer address arithmetic, 5 to compare/branch/loop, 5 to
 * neop FPU-hazard padding.  Three changes attack exactly those:
 *
 *  1) POINTERS ADVANCE.  The old loop indexed p_in_L[n] .. p_out_R[n], and the
 *     compiler re-derived all four addresses from base + slot*samples + n every
 *     sample.  It cannot strength-reduce them by itself because in and out
 *     alias -- app_widen_process() calls widen_process(w, buf, buf, n).
 *
 *  2) THE DELAY LINE IS WALKED IN NON-WRAPPING RUNS.  delay_len is one
 *     WIDEN_DELAY_MS worth of samples (480 at 48 kHz / 10 ms) and a block is
 *     APP_BLOCK_FRAMES (32), so each of the two pointers wraps at most once per
 *     block.  Splitting the block at the wrap replaces the per-sample
 *     "subtract, test, add len, scale, add base" index dance -- about 13
 *     instructions for the read/write pair -- with two post-incremented
 *     accesses.  Correctness does not depend on 32 < 480: the run length is
 *     computed, so any block/delay_len combination is handled, just with more
 *     segments.
 *
 *  3) THE CORE IS 2x UNROLLED.  That retires the all-pass state shuffle (x1/y1
 *     alternate between registers instead of being copied every sample) and
 *     gives the scheduler independent work for the hazard slots the 1x loop
 *     pads with neop.  Unrolling requires delay_samp >= 2, so that the pair's
 *     two delayed reads cannot alias its two writes; below that the 1x tail
 *     loop takes the whole run.
 *
 * Aliasing contract, unchanged in spirit but now relied on for two samples at a
 * time: out must either be in itself or not overlap in at all.  A partially
 * shifted overlap was already unsupported.

/*
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * FUSED TWO-STAGE PATH
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * app_widen_process() runs the widener twice in series, in place.  Stage 1
 * re-mixes Mid/Side back to L/R and stage 2 immediately re-splits them; those
 * two operations cancel, and every gain involved folds into a constant:
 *
 *   stage 1 out   L1 = (M + y1) * gh1        M   = L + R        gh1 = 0.5*g1
 *                 R1 = (M - y1) * gh1        y1  = ap1(delay1(sg1*(L - R)))
 *
 *   stage 2 in    M2 = L1 + R1 = 2*gh1*M  = g1*M
 *                 S2 = (L1 - R1) * sg2    = y1 * (g1*sg2)
 *
 *   stage 2 out   L' = (M2 + y2) * gh2 = M*(g1*gh2) + y2*gh2
 *                 R' = (M2 - y2) * gh2 = M*(g1*gh2) - y2*gh2
 *
 * So stage 2 never needs L/R: its Mid and Side are stage 1's M and y1 scaled by
 * constants.  Three coefficients carry all four gains:
 *
 *   k_mid  = g1 * gh2         <- Mid's total path gain
 *   k_out  = gh2              <- the outstanding 0.5 of the doubled M/S, once
 *   k_side = g1 * sg2         <- stage-1 remix and stage-2 split, collapsed
 *
 * Note there is no factor of 2 anywhere: stage 2 computes its own Mid as
 * L1 + R1, which already IS the doubled convention the header describes, and
 * 2*gh1 is just g1.  Getting this wrong would be a plain gain error, audible.
 *
 * What that removes per sample, relative to running the fast path twice: two FP
 * adds (the stage-2 M/S split), two stores and two loads (stage 1's L/R out and
 * stage 2's L/R in), and one entire loop's address arithmetic and loop control.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT BIT-EXACT, and that is the reason it is a separate path rather
 * than a rewrite of widen_process().  Two roundings genuinely disappear: the
 * sequential form rounds L1 and R1 to float32 and then rounds their sum and
 * difference again, while the fused form carries M and y1 straight through.  The
 * algebra is identical, the arithmetic is not.  Acceptance is therefore an error
 * norm plus a listening pass -- see tools/widen_bitexact/widen_bitexact.py and
 * recorded validation.
 *
 * It does NOT introduce a new state convention.  delay_buf2 ends up holding
 * y1 * g1 * sg2, which is the value the sequential path writes there as
 * (L1 - R1) * sg2.  So the two paths stay state-compatible and may be switched
 * between mid-stream, like the doubled-Side convention in widen_ctrl.h.
 *
 * Structure mirrors widen_process_fast_nohpf_delay_ap(): non-wrapping runs, a 2x
 * unrolled core and a 1x tail, and the same aliasing contract (out is in itself
 * or does not overlap it).  The run length is now the shortest of FOUR indices
 * instead of two, since both delay lines are walked at once.

/*
 * Turning widening off means enabled = false, not "enabled with every feature

 *
 * The old form passed enabled = true and switched the features off one by one.
 * That still ran the full per-sample loop -- measured at ~70 instructions per
 * sample across the two stages, ~22 us of the 666.7 us block, i.e. nearly the
 * cost of having widening ON -- to compute a unity M/S round trip.  With
 * enabled = false, widen_process() takes its passthrough exit, and because the
 * app calls it in place (in == out) the passthrough copies nothing: the cost is
 * zero.
 *
 * It is also more accurate, not less.  The round trip
 * 0.5*(L+R) + 0.5*(L-R) does not return L exactly -- (L+R) and (L-R) each round
 * -- so the "neutral" path was quietly lossy.  Skipping it is exact.
 *
 * Nothing else changes: the disabled state already had use_delay = false, so
 * the delay buffer was not being written either way, and re-enabling starts
 * from the same state it did before.
