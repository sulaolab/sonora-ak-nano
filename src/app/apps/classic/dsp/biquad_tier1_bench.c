 * arm with opt_v1's exact instruction count was still 34.8 % slower. The
 * attribution survived - the stall is an FPU register dependency and opt_v1 has
 * none - but the location did not.
 *
 * So this arm asks the same question one level in. Each sample accumulates d1 in
 * two steps through one F-register, with a store between them and nothing that
 * could cover latency. Arm 5 builds that loop four times with 0, 1, 2 and 3
 * independent issue slots between the d1 partial and the d1 final, IN BOTH

 * separating the two operands needs a different arm shape and is not attempted
 * here. A flat event 8 kills the distance explanation for this edge too.
 *
 * Arm 4's kernels, tables and measurement functions are untouched by this arm -
 * it selects a different kernel file (biquad_cascade_df2T_f32_dspic33ak_d1gap.s)

 *
 * WHAT THE TWO EXPERIMENTS ESTABLISHED, WHICH IS WHY THESE FOUR
 *   opt_v1 is LATENCY-bound, not issue-bound. It retires 10.433 instructions
 *   per sample/section in 11.484 cycles, and every one of those excess cycles is
 *   ONE stall: ev9 = 0.999, the CPU unable to read an F-register. ev8 is exactly
 *   zero. Meanwhile opt_v3 showed that removing instructions from a single
 *   channel's chain converts them straight into ev8 (-1.5 instructions, +4
 *   cycles), and Phase C showed those stall cycles are genuinely empty issue
 *   slots: three nopr per pair inserted into them cost nothing measurable.
 *
 *   Empty slots plus a 3-cycle MAC latency (DS70005540C Table 6-2) means the way
 *   forward is to put USEFUL work in the slots, not to remove instructions.
 *   Two ways to get useful independent work, and this arm measures both:
 *
 *   sp_a / sp_b / sp_c  Reschedule ONE channel so the y consumer is further from
 *                       the y producer. Same 10 instructions, same arithmetic,
 *                       same 1..512 blockSize contract as opt_v1 - so a winner
 *                       here is a drop-in replacement. Ceiling is opt_v1's one
 *                       stall cycle: about 11.484 -> 10.5, call it -8 %.
 *
 *   x2                  Interleave TWO INDEPENDENT CHANNELS, whose MACs cannot
 *                       depend on each other, so each covers the other's
 *                       latency. 9.0 instructions per sample against opt_v1's
 *                       10.0 and every producer-consumer distance >= 5 against
 *                       opt_v1's 3. Much larger prize (predicted -17 to -19 %)
 *                       but it needs a new call shape and equal stage counts.

         * channel inherited the previous channel's final state - and then ran the

         * and left a residual of 1,110 e-9 against a 10,000 e-9 tolerance: NOT
         * CAUGHT. That was a NEGATIVE-TEST DESIGN DEFECT, not a clean-path kernel
         * failure - and strictly speaking it was warm-up working exactly as
         * intended, since forgetting the initial state is what warm-up is for.
         * (On lp6, warm-up 0 blocks, the identical guard fired at 448,774,272
         * e-9, which is why the defect hid for as long as it did.)
         *
         * So the fault now means "the observation block ran on the wrong
         * channel's state" rather than "state was never reset". Channel 0 is
         * unaffected by construction - it is the state being borrowed - exactly
         * as it was unaffected before, so detection still comes from channels
         * 1..N.
         *
         * The state borrowed is channel 0's state at the END of its run, not at
         * the end of its warm-up. Corrected 2026-09-17, before the redesign ever
         * reached hardware, by running this known-answer test off-target
         * (the host-side known-answer test). Snapshotting after warm-up fixed ap84 -
         * 1,087,289,600 e-9, caught - and simultaneously BLINDED lp6, whose
         * warm-up is 0 blocks: with nothing processed yet, channel 0's
         * post-warm-up state is the zeroed state that t1_configure() gives every
         * channel anyway, so imposing it perturbs nothing and the residual came
         * back at exactly the clean-run value, 89 e-9. The first design was blind
         * on the long bank and the second would have been blind on the short one,
         * for opposite reasons. Taking the snapshot one block later is blind on
         * neither: after channel 0's observation block the state is non-zero for
         * any bank, whatever its warm-up count.
         *
         * Nothing else moves: warm-up counts, coefficient banks, the clean KAT

/*
 * The opt_v3 dispatch wrapper versus opt_v1, bit for bit, at several block
 * lengths.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM THE KAT ABOVE
 * The KAT compares against the shared reference at T1_FRAMES, which is 32 for
 * every caller in the tree. That only ever reaches the even fast path, so the
 * KAT passing says nothing about the odd-length route. A kernel whose odd path
 * is unreachable in test and reachable in production is exactly the shape of
 * defect this project has been bitten by, so the odd lengths here are the point
 * of the function, not padding.
 *
 * WHAT IS UNDER TEST IS THE WRAPPER, deliberately. The wrapper is what callers
 * see and what holds opt_v1's 1..512 contract; testing the bare kernel at odd
 * lengths would only confirm that it refuses them. Routing correctness - even
 * lengths reaching opt_v3, odd lengths reaching opt_v1, neither silently
 * dropping a sample - is the property that matters, and it is visible here as
 * bit equality at every length.
 *
 * Bit equality is the right bar rather than a tolerance. On even lengths opt_v3
 * performs the same five operations on the same values in the same order as
 * opt_v1 and only renames registers; on odd lengths the wrapper calls opt_v1
 * itself. So ANY difference is a defect in the register rotation or in the
 * routing, not rounding - and a tolerance would hide precisely the
 * one-sample-stale-state failure the swap could plausibly introduce. Nothing
 * here touches the KAT's own tolerances.
 *
 * A zero-difference result at an odd length is a weaker statement than at an
 * even one - the wrapper is comparing opt_v1 against opt_v1 - so it proves the
 * route was taken and no sample was dropped, not that any new arithmetic is
 * right. Both are worth having: dropping the tail sample is the failure this
 * catches.
 *
 * Each run re-inits the shared instance, so the comparison is per-call rather
 * than across a carried state chain.

 * ONE TIMER TICK IS NOT ONE INSTRUCTION CYCLE ON THIS PART.
 *
 * dsPIC33A issues up to one instruction per clock, so the instruction rate is

 * (100 MHz, 1:1 prescale) - the repo's "instruction-cycle frequency" comment on
 * FCY is the classic two-clocks-per-instruction dsPIC model and does not apply
 * here. So one tick is PLL1_CLK_HZ / FCY = 2 instruction cycles, and a bench
 * that prints raw ticks as "cycles" reads half the real figure.
 *
 * Confirmed two independent ways on AK512 (2026-08-21): a 199-instruction FIR
 * completing in 113 ticks is impossible at one instruction per tick, and the
 * existing telemetry's tick-to-us conversion already matches the real 333.3 us
 * TDM window.
 *
 * The ratio is derived from the clock tree rather than written as a literal 2,
 * so it cannot go quietly stale if the tree changes. The us values the timer
 * produces are correct as they stand - it is only "cycles" that needs this.

 * The eight events, in counter order.
 *
 * Counters 0 and 1 are the cycle and instruction references, which is what makes
 * the printed CPI meaningful (DS70005591D section 3.5.3.2). The other six are
 * the stall classification, and the choice is deliberately not just event 8:
 *
 *   8  FPU instr stall  - the hypothesis under test: FPU pipeline stalled on a
 *                         register data dependency.
 *   9  FPU read stall   - the CPU side of the same hazard. The DF2T loop stores
 *                         y one instruction after computing it, so this is where
 *                         that shows up. Reading 8 without 9 would attribute a
 *                         store-side stall to the cross-sample edge.
 *   3  FPU write stall  - the opposite direction, for completeness of the FPU
 *                         picture.
 *   7  CPU addr hazard  - a non-FPU data dependency would mean the mechanism is
 *                         not the FPU at all.
 *  13  fetch read stall - RULES OUT the instrument. The sweep arms are physically
 *                         LONGER loops, so if adding instructions cost cycles
 *                         through program fetch rather than through scheduling,
 *                         this is the counter that says so. Without it, a fetch
 *                         penalty would be indistinguishable from "spacing did
 *                         not help".
 *   6  branch mispredict- the loop is a dtb per pair; a mispredict difference
 *                         between arms would be an alternative explanation.
 *
 * Eight events, eight counters: nothing had to be dropped, so there is no second
 * pass and no risk of two passes disagreeing.
