 * Type_LB AVAS : L3 NOISE bank coefficients  (GENERATED -- DO NOT EDIT)
 *
 * GENERATED, and the generator is not part of this repository: this table is the
 * shipped artifact, not something to hand-edit or re-derive here.
 *
 * Model, the NOISE half of L3:
 *     noise(t) = sum_b NG[b] * 10^(g_b(t)/20) * noise_b(t)
 *     g_b = a slow random walk, sd 1.5 dB at 1.2 Hz, independent per band
 * Uniform movement across bands with no per-band onset ramp is what makes this L3
 * rather than L8, and it is why the table below is only {F, gain} per band.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS: ONE white source, tilted once, feeding 12 Chamberlin
 * state-variable bandpasses whose outputs are summed with FITTED gains.
 *
 * WHY THE GAINS ARE FITTED AND NOT THE TARGETS.  The coefficient set's band levels
 * are per-band targets with no skirt overlap; a filter bank cannot be that, so the
 * composite is NOT the sum of the targets.  The gains are fitted on the COHERENT
 * sum |sum_b g_b H_b(f)| -- coherent because one shared source means overlapping
 * skirts add with their phases -- in LOG magnitude, so a band 14 dB down counts as
 * much as the loudest one.
 *
 * WHY A STATE-VARIABLE FORM. Not for a prior Q15 implementation's reason
 * (a Q15 direct-form `a1` at the lowest band's centre moves the pole ANGLE by
 * 100 %), which does not apply here -- but the SVF tunes on F = 2 sin(pi f0 / fs),
 * it is three multiplies, and it is the form that port's fitted response was
 * measured on, so keeping it is what makes the two boards' noise the same noise.
 *
 * WHY THE SOURCE IS TILTED.  A 2nd-order skirt falls at 6 dB/octave and this target
 * falls at 12.4 dB/octave above 1 kHz, so no vector of gains can fix it: the
 * loudest band puts a floor across the whole top of the spectrum.  The tilt costs a
 * handful of operations ONCE for the entire bank.
 *
 * BANDS.  12 of the target's 18 are built, against the Q15 port's 12.  Two ceilings
 * decide that, and NEITHER is a word length:
 *   - the SVF's own stability bound F < 2 - 1/Q = 1.626, reached near fs/4, which
 *     excludes the top band (target -51 dB);
 *   - a band the FIT refuses, whose gain goes to zero.  It cannot contribute and
 *     still costs three multiplies a sample, so it is not built.  This is the same
 *     event as the Q15 port's band 11, decided by the fit instead of by the
 *     quantiser.
 * What the extra bands buy back is the 3.6-5.3 kHz air that port recorded as its
 * own worst omission at -12.05 dB.

 *
 * How well the built bank matches its per-band targets, in the frequency domain:
 * rms 0.38 dB over the 12 built bands, 3.53 dB over all 17 the SVF can hold.  Both
 * numbers matter -- a bank scored only on the bands it chose to build would look
 * good for pruning whatever it fits badly.
 *
 * MEASURED over 20 s of the arithmetic this header configures:
 *   band shape error mean +0.29 dB, worst -0.73 dB, rms 0.49 dB
 *   noise rms 2.698742e-02 against the target 2.698742e-02 (+0.00 dB)
 *   noise/tone -17.85 dB against the coefficient set's -17.85 dB
 *   gust sd 1.56 dB against the model's 1.50 dB
 *   peak |noise| 0.119694, folded into AVAS_TYPE_LB_L3_PEAK_ABS
 *   the difference equations agree with the transfer function the fit used to
 *   -168.3 dB (a mismatch there would make every number above wrong)
 *
 * THE LEVEL HAS NO FREE PARAMETER.  NG[b] and the tone's AMP[] are in the SAME
 * units, so tone + noise is a sum with nothing to tune: the gains below already
 * carry the one scalar that converts this bank's white source into those units,
 * measured (k = 1.887511e-01) rather than derived.
