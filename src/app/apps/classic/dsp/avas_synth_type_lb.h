// This module is a 48 kHz mono source for fx_domain_48k.
// It does not directly process the system ch-major DMA buffer.

// Sound engine: L3 = line model + noise bank.
//   tone(t)  = sum_j AMP[j] * cos(2*pi*FRQ[j]*t + PHA[j])      j = 1..264
//            = sum_k Re{ e^{i 2 pi FC[k] t} * Z_k(t) }         k = 1..7 carriers
//   noise(t) = one tilted white source through a bank of state-variable
//              bandpasses, per-band gains fitted, per-band slow gusts
// Coefficients live in avas_synth_type_lb_tables.h and
// avas_synth_type_lb_noise_tables.h (both generated, do not edit).

// THE TONE HALF IS THE SAME ARITHMETIC AS avas_synth_type_ty.c, and that is the
// whole reason this voice was affordable to add: L3's tone part and the Type_TY
// L1 model are one equation with two coefficient sets.  Only the noise bank is
// new DSP.  If you change the cluster/envelope scheme in one of the two files,
// change it in both -- they are deliberately line-for-line comparable.
//
// This REPLACES the former v07 additive model (16 partials, per-partial AM from
// two LFOs, three `carrier^power` pulse voices, five shared pitch-wander LFOs,
// xorshift noise through a one-pole).  That engine is a different lineage --
// the `type_lb_..._v1..v6` series, not `L1..L8` -- and it is gone rather than
// switchable.  Its gain API (low/core/noise/master) went with
// it: a line model has no `low` and `core` partial groups, so the knobs here
// are tone / noise / master.

/* Envelope decimation: each cluster's complex envelope Z_k is rebuilt once
 * every AVAS_TYPE_LB_DEC samples and linearly interpolated in between, while the
 * carriers run at the full 48 kHz.  Same knob, same units and same measured
 * behaviour as AVAS_TYPE_TY_DEC -- see avas_synth_type_ty.h for the decimation study.
 * It was measured on the Type_TY table, but the quantity it trades (envelope
 * bandwidth against load) is set by the cluster half-span, and this voice's
 * spans are NARROWER (max |f - fc| 60.7 Hz against the Type_TY's 158.9), so
 * D = 32 has more headroom here rather than less.
 *
 * Cost is  AVAS_TYPE_LB_L3_CLUSTERS  full-rate carriers  +
 *          AVAS_TYPE_LB_L3_TABLE_LINES / AVAS_TYPE_LB_DEC  baseband oscillators
 *          + the noise bank's sections, which do NOT decimate.
 *
 * Note which way round the two voices sit: this one has MORE lines (264 vs 185)
 * and FEWER carriers (7 vs 11), because all of its energy is below 1.2 kHz.
 * The carriers are the expensive half, so the TONE part of the Type_LB is
 * cheaper than the Type_TY's despite the longer table.  The noise bank is what
 * puts the total above it.
 *
 * Do NOT trim the line count to buy load: L3 is defined as ALL 264 detected
 * lines (the truncated variants are L4/L5/L8, a different model).  The knobs
 * are this decimation and the noise bank's band count. */

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Run-time pitch trim, driven by the POT while this engine is the sounding one.
 *
 * Deliberately the same clamp and knob range as the TYPE_TY engine (AVAS_TYPE_TY_PITCH_*
 * / AVAS_TYPE_TY_POT_TOP_CENT): the two are runtime-exclusive and share the one knob,
 * so one learned feel has to cover both.  They are separate #defines
 * rather than shared ones because the two voices may legitimately diverge later
 * -- what is shared is the operator's hand, not the tuning.
 *
 * The L3 table is a fixed-pitch coefficient set, so there is no drift of its own
 * to reach, and there is no engine wander to trim against any more either -- the
 * v07 model's five wander LFOs (+-18.2 cent peak against a 55 Hz base) went with
 * that engine, and a line model's pitch is whatever these #defines make it.  So
 * the range is anchored to the OTHER engine's: TYPE_TY sets 200 cent, and one POT
 * has to serve both.
 *
 * HOW IT IS APPLIED -- and this is where L3 differs from the v07 engine that used
 * to be here.  v07 multiplied a base step by pitch_ratio every sample, so a trim
 * was one float write.  A line model has no base step: the carriers and the 264
 * baseband offsets ARE the frequencies.  So a ratio is applied by rebuilding all
 * 271 steps from the const tables (avas_type_lb_set_steps), which is exactly what
 * TYPE_TY does, and for the same reason it must happen at an envelope-rebuild
 * boundary rather than under the caller's hand.  Hence the request/apply handshake
 * in the struct below: latency is at most AVAS_TYPE_LB_DEC samples (0.67 ms), and
 * the cost is 271 multiplies per accepted change against a POT that samples at
 * 10 Hz.  The accepted-update cost is deliberately small relative to the
 * control polling rate.
 *
 * The NOISE BANK is not pitched: its band frequencies are fixed band edges, not
 * harmonics of the engine, so the wind does not transpose with the tone.  That is
 * deliberate. */
