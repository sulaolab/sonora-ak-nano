//===========================================================
// Definition
//===========================================================

/* The measured V8 model, sample by sample.
 *
 * One engine cycle = 2 crank revolutions, so f_cycle = rpm / 120 and every
 * table here is indexed by cycle phase, not by time. That is why a table of P
 * points per cycle is band-limited to crank ORDER P/4 and not to a fixed Hz --
 * see the point-count table printed into engine_v8_tables.h.
 *
 * Per sample:
 *     wave   two neighbouring RPM bins, linearly interpolated in phase and
 *            crossfaded by rpm
 *     noise  two readers into one shared table, one engine cycle apart, summed
 *            through a periodic Hann window (they are exactly half a window
 *            apart, so the pair of weights is w and 1-w from ONE table)
 *     mask   out = wave + n + gate * LPF1k5( (MASK_AMT-1) * n )
 *
 * The mask is what keeps a fast RPM change from sounding like a chord: below
 * 2125 rpm the wavetables are one transposed waveform (there is no recording of
 * 900-2100 rpm), and the extra low-passed noise while |d rpm/dt| is large covers
 * it. The gate is 0 whenever the speed is steady, so the settled idle -- the part
 * that was listened to and accepted -- is bit-for-bit unmasked.
 *
 * Every number below is frozen: a constant edited in isolation is a change of
 * sound, not a tuning knob.  Numbers, and why each one is what it is:
 *   recorded validation, section 39
 *   validated against the prototype by tools/classic/astm_v8_resynth/a34_impl_check.py

 * down to win[0] = 0 over the last 1/256 of every cycle, i.e. a notch in the noise
 * at the cycle boundary at exactly the rate being synthesised.
 *
 * BOTH weights come from this ONE table, and the pair is POWER-complementary
 * (w_new^2 + w_old^2 == 1), not amplitude-complementary. That is the criterion
 * that applies here: the two noise readers take INDEPENDENT random offsets into
 * the noise table, so they are uncorrelated, and uncorrelated signals add in
 * power. The table used to be a rising Hann half with the caller using
 * `(w, 1 - w)` -- which sums to exactly 1 in AMPLITUDE, and therefore ran the

 * once per engine cycle, by construction. Measured on the output at a held
 * 4400 rpm, noise only, 3-6 kHz: 4.88 dB peak-to-trough over the cycle, i.e. a
 * 36.7 Hz amplitude modulation of a band that is 98 % noise above ~3700 rpm. That
 * is what the owner heard as churu-churu over 3400-5100 rpm. The table is now
 * sin(pi*ph/2) and the falling weight is cos(pi*ph/2) = sin(pi*(1-ph)/2), i.e.
 * this same table read backwards -- so the fix costs no ROM, only a second
 * interpolation per sample (which is why the old form was chosen).
 *
 * The reversed read is done in the INDEX domain on purpose: calling this with
