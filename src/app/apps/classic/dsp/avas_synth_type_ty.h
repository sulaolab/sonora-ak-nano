 // It does not directly process the system ch-major DMA buffer.

 // Sound engine: L1 line model, synthesised as cluster carriers with a
 // decimated complex envelope (see avas_synth_type_ty.c header comment).
 //   y(t) = sum_j AMP[j] * cos(2*pi*FRQ[j]*t + PHA[j])
 //        = sum_k Re{ e^{i 2 pi FC[k] t} * Z_k(t) }

/* Envelope decimation: each cluster's complex envelope Z_k is rebuilt once every
 * AVAS_TYPE_TY_DEC samples and linearly interpolated in between, while the carriers
 * run at the full 48 kHz.  This is the only load knob that matters.
 *
 * Cost is  AVAS_TYPE_TY_L1_CLUSTERS  full-rate carriers  +
 *          AVAS_TYPE_TY_L1_TABLE_LINES / AVAS_TYPE_TY_DEC  baseband oscillators per sample.
 *
 * Measured (float32, same parabolic sine as the firmware, 2 s of signal, error
 * expressed as level of the 13 bands that actually contain lines):
 *      D =  8   54.0 dB below signal   band error mean 0.004 dB
 *      D = 16   53.1 dB                band error mean 0.008 dB
 *      D = 32   48.0 dB                band error mean 0.041 dB   <- default
 *      D = 64   36.5 dB                band error mean 0.184 dB   (too coarse)
 *   185 full-rate oscillators (the direct engine this replaced, 137 % of the
 *   per-sample budget):  49.2 dB, band error mean 0.003 dB.
 * So D = 32 is quality parity with the direct engine at ~1/7 of the cost.
 *
 * Measured on hardware (TDMsum, 32-sample block): AVAS costs 304.8 us of the
 * 666.6 us window = 45.8 %, i.e. ~1900 cycles per sample -- 2.4x the ~790
 * instructions counted from the assembly, because float ops are not 1 cycle.
 * It no longer overflows (margin 180.5 us, miss 0), but the split is carriers
 * ~31 % / envelope ~14 %, so RAISING THIS KNOB BARELY HELPS ANY MORE: D = 64
 * would save ~7 % and cost 48.0 -> 36.5 dB.  What is left to win is the 22
 * fast sin/cos calls per sample in the carrier loop.  A per-carrier rotator
 * (a complex multiply) can replace them.
 *
 * Do NOT trim the line count instead.  Measured: keeping the strongest 32 lines
 * silences 7 of the 13 occupied bands (mean band error 64 dB), and even an
 * optimal per-band quota still leaves 5.2 dB mean / 8.8 dB max.  The clustering
 * costs 0.04 dB.  Override from app_specific_config_defs.h or a build -Define. */

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Run-time pitch trim, driven by the POT while this engine is the sounding one
 * (classic_controls.c).  There is no hotkey: an absolute knob and incremental
 * keys writing one value needs takeover arbitration, for a second way to do the
 * same thing.
 *
 * The L1 table is a fixed-pitch coefficient set, so the engine has no pitch of
 * its own to follow.  The trim exists to place that fixed pitch by ear over
 * roughly half a semitone of range, NOT to transpose the model; the numbers
 * below are sized for that use.
 *
 * A ratio r multiplies EVERY line's frequency, carriers and baseband offsets
 * alike, so it is an exact pitch shift of the whole model (see
 * avas_type_ty_set_steps()).  Because the steps are rebuilt from the const table
 * rather than scaled in place, applying a ratio is idempotent -- which is what
 * makes the request/apply handshake below race-free.
 *
 * Accuracy cost of the range: r scales each cluster's baseband span, and the
 * envelope's linear-interpolation error grows roughly with r^2.  At the +200 cent
 * top (r = 1.1225) that is +26 %, i.e. about 1 dB off the measured 48.0 dB at
 * AVAS_TYPE_TY_DEC = 32 -- irrelevant.  A transposition of an octave (r = 2, 4x the
 * error, 6 dB) is where this stops being free, and AVAS_TYPE_TY_DEC would have to come
 * down to pay for it. */
