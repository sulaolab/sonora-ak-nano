/* =========================================================================
 * TYPE_TY AVAS synth : L1 line model, run as cluster carriers
 *
 * Replaces the former v3 cluster model (harmonic-grid style: low anchor +
 * 723 Hz cluster + 1.45/1.55 kHz cluster + shared slow FM/AM + glue noise).
 * That engine is gone, not switchable: see WHY IT IS NOT A HARMONIC GRID below.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 * ------------
 *     y(t) = sum_j AMP[j] * cos(2*pi*FRQ[j]*t + PHA[j])          j = 1..185
 *
 * Nothing else.  No FM, no AM, no noise, no envelope beyond the on/off gate.
 * The coefficients are a fixed line-model set -- one frequency, amplitude and
 * phase per line -- generated offline and shipped in
 * avas_synth_type_ty_tables.h.  The engine has no pitch of its own to follow.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT A HARMONIC GRID
 * -----------------------------
 * The v3 model synthesised a grid of f0 multiples with per-partial gains.  It
 * sounded thin, and the reason is structural rather than a tuning problem:
 *   - most lines in this coefficient set do not sit on any multiple of the
 *     lowest component, so a grid cannot place them at all.
 *   - what is perceived as one harmonic is a group of 6-13 separate lines
 *     within +-10 Hz of each other, all within 10 dB.  Their mutual beating
 *     IS the perceived richness, and a single partial per grid slot cannot
 *     produce it -- not with AM, not with FM.
 *   - some grid slots hold no line whatsoever.
 * So the grid was abandoned and the line list is used directly.  A grid is not
 * a cheaper approximation of this model; it is a different sound.
 *
 * HOW IT IS COMPUTED  (this is the part that changed)
 * --------------------------------------------------
 * Running 185 oscillators at 48 kHz overflowed the DSP load: the compiled inner
 * loop is ~25 instructions with 3-4 conditional branches per line, i.e. about
 * 5700 cycles against a 4166-cycle per-sample budget -- roughly 137 % for AVAS
 * alone.  The fix is a restructuring that keeps all 185 lines.
 *
 * Group the lines into contiguous clusters no wider than 200 Hz (11 of them for
 * this table).  Within one cluster, exactly:
 *
 *     sum_j A_j cos(2 pi f_j t + p_j) = Re{ e^{i 2 pi fc t} * Z(t) },
 *     Z(t) = sum_j A_j e^{i (2 pi (f_j - fc) t + p_j)}
 *
 * Z is band-limited to the cluster half-span (<= 100 Hz), so it does NOT need
 * to be evaluated at 48 kHz.  Each cluster's Z is rebuilt every AVAS_TYPE_TY_DEC
 * samples and linearly interpolated in between; only the 11 carriers run at full
 * rate.  The rebuilds are STAGGERED: cluster k rebuilds at its own phase within
 * the shared decimation period, so the per-sample cost is nearly flat instead of
 * arriving as one burst every D-th sample (see WHY THE REBUILDS ARE STAGGERED).
 * Cost drops from 185 full-rate oscillators to 11 carriers plus 185/32
 * baseband oscillators per sample -- about 1/7, with the same output.
 *
 * Two details are load-bearing, both established by measurement:
 *   - The rebuild evaluates the envelope ONE BLOCK AHEAD and interpolates
 *     towards it.  Interpolating towards a value already reached delays the
 *     envelope by a whole block, and that delay alone drops accuracy from
 *     48.0 dB to 15.3 dB below signal.  See avas_type_ty_rebuild_cluster().
 *   - The carrier frequency is the cluster's AMPLITUDE-WEIGHTED centroid, not
 *     its geometric middle, so the strongest lines get the smallest baseband
 *     offset and therefore the smallest interpolation error.  Set by the
 *     generator; see the cluster table in avas_synth_type_ty_tables.h.
 *
 * The old direct 185-oscillator engine is not kept behind a switch.  Trimming
 * the line count is NOT the way to buy load either: keeping the strongest 32
 * lines silences 7 of the 13 occupied bands, and even an optimal per-band quota
 * leaves 5.2 dB mean band error, whereas this restructuring costs 0.04 dB.
 * AVAS_TYPE_TY_DEC is the knob.
 *
 * COST
 * ----
 * Measured on hardware: 304.8 us of the 666.6 us block window (45.8 %), margin
 * 180.5 us, no missed block.  The overflow is gone, but this is more than the
 * ~18 % that was aimed for: the carriers dominate (~31 % vs ~14 % for the
 * envelope), so AVAS_TYPE_TY_DEC is no longer the lever -- see avas_synth_type_ty.h.
 *
 * RAM is 2 floats per line (baseband phase + step) plus 6 floats per cluster.
 * Amplitudes stay in flash; the uniform gains are applied once to the summed
 * output.
 *
 * WHY THE REBUILDS ARE STAGGERED  (2026-08-29, AK128 Classic)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 * Rebuilding all 11 clusters on the same sample puts all 185 baseband
 * oscillators inside ONE block ISR.  That is only affordable where the block is
 * as long as the decimation period.  It is on AK512 (APP_BLOCK_FRAMES = 32 = D,
 * 666.6 us window); it is NOT on AK128 Classic (APP_BLOCK_FRAMES = 4, 83.3 us),
 * where the measured miss rate was EXACTLY 1 block in 8 = D/APP_BLOCK_FRAMES
 * (13,275 misses in 106,194 blocks = 0.125000), each of those blocks taking
 * 180.3 us against an 83.3 us deadline.  It was heard as a 6 kHz train of
 * dropouts.  The load line read 70.8 %, i.e. inside budget, and that is exactly
 * why it was not believed: a missed block is a HALF+DONE conflict, so one service
 * pass in eight never ran and the average was measured over a system doing
 * seven-eighths of the work.  With the stagger in place and nothing else changed,
 * the same image measures 84.7 % and miss = 0.
 *
 * The clusters are mutually independent, so each one keeps a rebuild period of
 * exactly D samples while starting at a different phase; accuracy is therefore
 * unchanged (the interpolation interval is what sets it, and that is still D).
 * The stagger is spaced by CUMULATIVE LINE COUNT, not by cluster index -- the
 * clusters hold 25,27,27,19,13,19,28,10,9,6,2 lines, so spacing by index would
 * put clusters 0 and 1 (52 lines between them) in the same 4-frame block, where
 * balancing by line count caps the worst block at 32.  See
 * avas_type_ty_cluster_slot(), and
 * recorded validation.
 *
 * AK128 Classic then moved to APP_BLOCK_FRAMES = 32 as well, so the stagger is no
 * longer what stands between this engine and a missed block there.  It stays
 * because it is what makes the engine independent of the block length at all --
 * and because it is worth 8.8 us of peak on a 4-frame block, which is more than
 * that configuration had left.
 *
 * AVAS_TYPE_TY_DEC is NOT a lever against this: the burst is 185 lines whatever
 * D is, so lowering D only makes it more frequent (D = APP_BLOCK_FRAMES means
 * every block) and raising it leaves the same burst in 1 block out of
 * D/APP_BLOCK_FRAMES.
 *
 * KNOWN APPROXIMATIONS vs THE EXACT MODEL
 * ---------------------------------------
 *   - audio_fast_sinf_* is a parabolic approximation, not libm.  Per
 *     oscillator its distortion is low, but 185 of them intermodulate, so the
 *     output is not sample-exact against the model even though the
 *     coefficients are.  Measured floor in the line-free bands: -71.5 dBFS,
 *     against -72.4 dBFS for the direct engine this replaced.
 *   - Phase is a wrapped float accumulator, so each line's phase creeps
 *     relative to the ideal cos(2*pi*f*t) over long runs.  Absolute phases
 *     only matter mutually, and the drift is common-mode to first order.
 *   - The envelope is piecewise linear between rebuilds; see AVAS_TYPE_TY_DEC in
 *     avas_synth_type_ty.h for the measured accuracy per decimation factor.
 *   - The 4 s gate attack (unchanged from the previous engine) is long enough to
 *     dominate a short comparison, so shorten AVAS_TYPE_TY_GATE_ATTACK_S before
 *     comparing renders.
