; asrc_thirdband_96_to_32_kernel_dspic33ak.s
;
; SHIPPING kernel of the 96 -> 32 kHz third-band 3-path polyphase allpass
; decimator.  The ARITHMETIC BODY is byte-identical to kernel A of the bench
; (asrc_thirdband_kernel_dspic33ak.s, ASRC_TB_BODY_A) -- 1 multiply and 2 state
; words per section, 12 instructions per section per CHANNEL PAIR, measured on
; hardware at 5.995 cycles/section/channel against a static count of 6.000.
; Do not "improve" the body: its instruction ORDER is what keeps the assembler
; from inserting neops, and its numbers are published.
;
; WHAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE BENCH, and why each difference had to exist
; (the bench's 106.19 cycles/32k output/ch did not pay any of these):
;
;   1 REAL I/O.  The bench re-read one 3-row buffer every frame and overwrote one
;     output row.  Here the input cursor WALKS a gathered 96 kHz block and the
;     output cursor walks the 32 kHz block, so the commutator actually consumes
;     3 input frames per output frame.  Two add.l per frame.
;
;   2 THE BRANCH SUM IS DONE IN THE ACCUMULATOR, and the 1/3 with it.  The bench
;     summed the three branches with 32-bit add.l and left the 1/3 to be folded
;     into the downstream resampler.  Neither survives in the real chain:
;       * the sum reaches 3.0 FULL SCALE and OVERFLOWS a 32-bit Q31 add.  The
;         bench never saw it because its test signal was small.
;       * the resampler coefficient table is ONE build-time table shared by both
;         legs and every rate, so a 1/3 folded there would rescale chains that do
;         not use this front end.
;     So the three branch results go through three MACs against a 17th
;     coefficient word, c = floor(2^31 / 3), and one sacr.l saturates.  The
;     accumulator guard bits carry the 3.0 that a register could not.
;
;   3 THE HEADROOM RESTORE RIDES IN THAT sacr.l.  The caller shifts the input
;     right by ASRC_TB32_HSHIFT before the kernel sees it, because the host gate
;     measured the SECTION OUTPUTS -- which are stored int32 words -- reaching
;     1.01x full scale on a 997 Hz full-scale sine, 2.85x on full-scale noise and
;     4.97x at the L1 bound.  The shift is EXACT on an s24-left input (8 zero
;     sub-LSBs), so it costs no precision, and sacr.l a, #-HSHIFT, Wd puts the
;     factor back with rounding and saturation for no instruction at all.
;     * DIRECTION: a NEGATIVE shift field is the LEFT (x2^n) direction.  The boot
;       check catches a wrong sign at once -- it would be a factor of 64 -- and the
;       sign lives in one .equ below for exactly that reason.
;
;   4 THE s24-LEFT MASK, which the shipping chain applies at the end of its last
;     stage (dec_q31_to_s24_left) and the bench did not.  One and.l against a
;     register-held mask, because and.l's immediate field only reaches 127.
;
; Cost of 2 + 3 + 4 together: FOUR instructions per output per channel.
;
; PLACEMENT IS PART OF THE MEASUREMENT (DS70005591C 4.3.17).  In
; msc.l [w11], [w9], A the two operands must live in DIFFERENT data spaces or
; both reads serialise and the instruction silently costs an extra cycle.  The
; caller must therefore keep the COEFFICIENTS IN X and the STATE IN Y.  It does
; that by carving both out of the front end's existing declared arenas
; (s_q31_coeff is space(xmemory), s_q31_hist is space(ymemory)), which is also
; why this kernel costs no new RAM.
;
; STATE MUST BE A FLAT [ch][16][2] BLOCK with a 128-byte channel stride.  That is
; the stride the body was measured at; addressing the history array by its own
; 264-word row stride instead would change it, and an untouched stage moving on a
; placement change is a trap this tree has already paid for once.
;
; MODULO IS BRACKETED OFF, not merely unused: MODCON/XMODSRT/YMODSRT are not part
; of the per-IPL register context, so a window opened by
; fir_ring_q31_ymod_yonly_block is open in every context, and this kernel
; addresses Y through the MAC AGU.  Four instructions per CALL.
;
; The .size directives are load-bearing: tools/asrc/ymod_safety_gate.py
; attributes any instruction outside every sized symbol to the nearest preceding
; label, so an unsized kernel absorbs whatever the linker places after it.
