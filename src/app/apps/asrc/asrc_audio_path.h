// Deterministic rate change before the ASRC, per direction, as the COMPOSED ratio of every fixed
// stage ahead of the resampler -- which is what the feed-forward plan divides by.
//
// From a 48 kHz input leg one stage does the job: 6 for the 8 kHz path, 4 for 11.025 and 12 kHz,
// 3 for 16 kHz, 2 for 22.05 and 24 kHz, and 1 for direct ASRC operation.
//
// From a 96 kHz input leg a fixed 96 -> 48 kHz /2 pre-stage runs first and the existing chain
// behind it, so the ratio is the product: 12 for 8 kHz, 8 for 11.025 and 12 kHz, 6 for 16 kHz.
// 22.05 kHz and above stay direct at 1 -- their look-ahead already fits the ring, so they get no
// stage.  (This is why the value here can exceed any single stage's divider.)
//
// At most one of the two is ever != 1: only the DOWN-sampling direction gets a front end, since
// the up-sampling direction's step is below 1 and its look-ahead shrinks rather than clamping.
// One decimator instance is shared on that basis.
/* The active front end's exact rational ratio, num/den, per leg.  num is 1 for every integer
 * decimating chain and 2 for the 48 -> 32 kHz AUDIO MODE front end (L=2/M=3); den is 1 when that
 * leg has no front end.  Both are needed by the rate plan -- step_ff scales by num/den -- and
 * den alone no longer identifies a chain, because 2/3 and 1/3 share den == 3. */
