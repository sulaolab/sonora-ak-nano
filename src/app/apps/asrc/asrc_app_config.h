//   1 = decouple SPI2/WM8904-B from SPI1's clock and run it as an INDEPENDENT dsPIC
//       TDM master (FRC->PLL1->CLKGEN9 derived), with WM8904-B as its clock slave.
//       A-domain (SPI1) stays codec-A master / dsPIC slave (APP_USE_SPI_TDM_CLK_MASTER 0).
//       Result: A and B are two truly-async, fully independent in/out streams
//       (audio into A does NOT come out of B -- the co-clock A=B mirror is removed).
//   0 = legacy co-clock topology (SPI2 follows SPI1's BCLK/FS via CLC fan-out).
//   NOTE: transport groundwork for the A<->B ASRC (Phase 2+).
//
// APP_REQ_SPI2_INDEPENDENT_MASTER (the DERIVED request, from APP_PROFILE + APP_ASRC_CLOCK_OWNER)
// is now defined in the ASRC build-config (asrc_app_build_config.h), with a neutral 0 stub in the
// Classic build-config, so the shared config header does not reach into this ASRC-private header
// for it. The effective APP_USE_SPI2_INDEPENDENT_MASTER is still resolved in the shared Resolved
// section and is only 1 when the SPI2 audio path exists (AK512 dual-codec).

// SPI2 master BCLK divider (SPIxBRG). BCLK = PLL1_CLK_HZ / (2*(BRG+1)) = 100MHz/(BRG+1);

// (the 44.1kHz-leaning experiment value; exact 44.1k is unreachable from 200MHz -- see doc).
// Chosen EXPLICITLY (not derived from a target rate) to avoid the get_default_config()

 * 96 kHz CPU LOAD STUDY switch.  Bench-only.  Default 0, and it must stay 0 in every
 * shipping preset.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES: it lifts exactly two of the ENA_96K_RATE guards in asrc_app_validate.h,
 * and nothing else.  It does not change a filter, a rate, a block length, an interrupt
 * priority or a channel mapping.
 *
 * WHY TWO GUARDS AND NOT ONE SWITCH PER GUARD: the two belong to different constraint
 * families (see the three families named in asrc_app_build_config.h's 96 kHz comment),
 * and the reason each is liftable FOR A MEASUREMENT is different:
 *
 *   1. ASRC_CH <= 8 is a CPU-BUDGET guard.  It encodes an answer -- "8 is what the
 *      166.7 us window was measured to carry" -- to the very question a load study asks.
 *      Refusing to compile the measurement that would update it makes the number
 *      unfalsifiable.  So this switch does not weaken an ASRC limit; it re-opens the
 *      measurement the limit came from.  The guard stays in force for every build that
 *      does not set this switch, which is every real build.
 *
 *   2. APP_ENA_ASRC_BIDIR is a CODEC/HW guard, and it is NOT lifted as an audio claim.
 *      The WM8904 still cannot run ADC and DAC together at or above 88.2 kHz, and this
 *      switch does not pretend otherwise: leg A stays ADC-only and leg B stays DAC-only,
 *      because audio_transport.c derives both roles from the nominal RATE and never from
 *      this flag.  What BIDIR=1 changes is only how many ASRC ENGINES run -- two instead
 *      of one -- which is a DSP workload question, not a codec question.  Leg B's RX
 *      therefore carries no captured audio, so the B->A engine resamples whatever the
 *      idle ADCDAT line clocks in.  That is deliberate and it is the point: the study
 *      measures the compute cost of the bidirectional engine pair, and every channel is
 *      processed in full regardless of what its samples contain.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT LICENSE: do not read a pass from a build with this switch set as
 * "96 kHz bidirectional audio works", and do not cite its numbers without saying which
 * constraint family they answer.  A 96 kHz codec that is bidirectional at TDM8 removes
 * guard 2 outright; this switch never does.

 * against the shipping set's -108.38 dB.  In the PROTECTED band (0..13 kHz, reached only
 * from 35000 Hz up) it reads -108.78 dB against the shipping -110.23 dB, so the audible

 * The arithmetic is bit-identical by construction: the same float32 additions and the same
 * repeated `- 1.0f` in the same order, on the same values.  Only WHERE the two state words
 * live between output frames changes.  From the compiler output of the measured image the
 * advance costs 28 instructions per output frame, 8 of which are these loads and stores
 * (a->frac is reloaded and stored once per frame, a->rd once per wrap -- and at 96->32 the
 * step is ~3.0, so the wrap loop runs exactly three times per frame).
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A `*au` BIT.  The other three candidates are single call sites, so one
 * image can hold both arms and switch per frame.  This one cannot: the hoist is a property
 * of the LOOP, and any faithful in-image emulation of the un-hoisted arm would have to add
 * work to the baseline side, which biases the delta in the flattering direction -- the one
 * mistake that cannot be spotted afterwards in the numbers.  So this is a build switch and
 * its delta is a two-image delta.  Take it at 8 channels, where the run is fully non-starve
 * and leg B `cpu` MIN reproduced to 0.1 us across two windows of the same run.
 *
 * Semantic difference worth writing down: a->rd / a->frac are now written once per BLOCK
 * rather than once per frame.  Nothing reads them mid-block -- the servo, the telemetry and

 * process.  This holds at every sample rate and on every target -- it is a design rule, not a
 * property of one preset.
 *
 * Two other quantities are also counted in channels and must never be confused with it:
 *
 *   APP_SLOTS_PER_FS                    the PHYSICAL I/O width (WM8904 = 2 ch, I2S = 2 slots,
 *                                       TDM8 = 8).  Confined to the two mapping ends: the L/R pair
 *                                       is replicated into ASRC_CH on the way in, and ASRC_CH is
 *                                       narrowed to the slots on the way out.  It may not reach
 *                                       anything between those two ends.
 *   an implementation's own capability   e.g. ASRC_DECIMATOR_FLOAT_MAX_CHANNELS.  May only SELECT
 *                                       or VALIDATE an implementation.  An implementation that
 *                                       cannot carry ASRC_CH is DISQUALIFIED: the rate pairs that
 *                                       need it are refused with a reason, and it is never used at
 *                                       a reduced width.  No acknowledgement, no override -- every
 *                                       escape is "reduce the width until it fits" in disguise.
 *
 * Forbidden, each one a bug that has actually happened here:
 *   APP_SLOTS_PER_FS --X--> processing width   (a 2-slot bus is not a 2-channel filter)
 *   implementation capacity --X--> ASRC_CH     (a legacy limit is not a product specification)
 *   sample rate --X--> processing width        (a rate may set workload, never channel count)
 *   test width --X--> shipping width           (and not the reverse either)
 *
 * A TRANSPORT LIMIT HAS A SHELF LIFE; THE ASRC DOES NOT.  Every narrow number the transport
 * currently forces is an OPERATIONAL ESCAPE from the WM8904 on this evaluation board, and each one
 * disappears the day a different codec is adopted -- not relaxed, REMOVED:
 *
 *   2 slots at 96 kHz   because THIS codec's SYSCLK is a 12.288 MHz crystal and cannot clock the
 *                       24.576 MHz BCLK a TDM8 96 kHz frame needs.
 *   one-way A->B        because THIS codec cannot run ADC and DAC together at or above 88.2 kHz.
 *
 * A codec with a bidirectional TDM8 96 kHz mode removes both with NO ASRC change, which is only
 * true while the rule above is obeyed.  So an ASRC stage designed, sized, measured or specified
 * against "2 channels" or "one direction" is not merely inelegant -- it is already wrong, and it
 * fails silently, because it keeps building and keeps passing after the codec changes.  When
 * recording any measured number, say which constraint family produced it: codec/HW, ASRC
 * algorithm, or CPU budget.  See the 96 kHz preset block in asrc_app_build_config.h.
 *
 * The reason the rule is absolute: the codec on the evaluation board is one possible endpoint, not
 * the specification.  Reducing a width so a stage fits produces a number that measures nothing --
 * and for an anti-alias stage it is worse than nothing, because filtering fewer channels than the
 * resampler converts is a MISSING anti-alias stage, and down-conversion without one is not a
 * working conversion at any channel count. */
