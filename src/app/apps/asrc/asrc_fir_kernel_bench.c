//
// "*aq" -- measure the three candidate front-stage FIR kernels ON HARDWARE, in CPU cycles per MAC.
//
// The offline work (recorded validation) fixed the ISA ceiling from
// the instruction tables: float cannot go below 2 instructions per MAC because the FPU mac.s takes
// register operands only, while Q31 + REPEAT + MAC.l is 1 instruction per MAC.  Everything below
// exists to answer what an instruction table cannot:
//
//   M1  does 1 cycle/MAC actually come out, with the coefficients in X RAM and the history in Y?
//       And what does it cost when both land in X space -- the failure mode with no functional
//       symptom (4.3.17 charges "typically one cycle" extra per MAC).
//   M6  is a NON-power-of-two modulo ring legal, and at which start addresses?  4.3.18 says an
//       incrementing buffer has "certain restrictions on the buffer start address" and gives no
//       numeric rule; the vendor init routine enforces nothing.  This sweeps the start address and
//       lets the hardware answer.  It decides whether a 16ch 190-tap history costs 12,160 B or
//       16,384 B.
//
// HOW THE NUMBER IS TAKEN.  The high-res timer is Timer2 clocked at FCY with a 1:1 prescale, so one
// count is one instruction cycle and no conversion is involved.  Two things pollute a single
// reading: the TDM ISRs (~75% duty in the 16ch build) and DMA bus stealing.  Both are handled by
// reporting the MINIMUM over `trials` -- the trial that nothing interrupted -- with `near` counting
// the trials within 1/16 of it, which is the evidence that the floor is real and not a timer
// artefact.
//
// The headline per-MAC figure is a SLOPE, not a division: each kernel is measured at two tap counts
// and the per-MAC cost is (cycles_hi - cycles_lo) / (taps_hi - taps_lo).  That cancels the call
// overhead, the prologue, the timer read and the loop setup exactly, instead of hoping they are
// small.  The absolute per-call cost is printed next to it so the fixed overhead stays visible.
//
// RUNNING IT IS ITSELF A TEST of the interrupt-safety claim (report section 11): this runs in the
// foreground (CTX0) using ACCA, RCOUNT and the CORCON DSP bits while the TDM ISRs run at IPL4
// (CTX4) using the same resources.  If that context banking did not hold, the correctness checks
// below would fail rather than the numbers merely drifting.

// app_specific_config_defs.h comes FIRST, and the order matters: the build profile
// sets ASRC_FIR_KERNEL_BENCH_AVAILABLE (the shipping BiDir profile sets it to 0 to
// get its 1,184 B of data memory back), and asrc_fir_kernel_bench.h only respects
// that with #ifndef -- reached the other way round, this file would compile the
// bench in while asrc_console.c, which does include the app config first, compiles
// its caller out. Nothing errors in that state; the RAM just comes back. Any
// measurement of this profile's data memory catches it (see

// ---- where the operands live --------------------------------------------------------------------
// The 1 cycle/MAC claim rests entirely on the two MAC operands arriving over different buses, so
// placement IS the experiment.  Two hard constraints shape how it is done here, and both are
// findings in their own right rather than implementation noise:
//
//  * X data space is 0x4000..0xBFFF and Y is 0xC000..0x13FFF.  The 16-channel BIDIRECTIONAL profile
//    fills X completely -- 2 bytes free, one BSS object running across the boundary -- so this bench
//    cannot run there at all, and neither can a Q31 front end: Q31 needs its coefficients in X and
//    that image has no X space to put them in.  Measured on the one-way profile, which frees an
//    engine and leaves X with room.
//  * A DECLARED object in Y space breaks the serial-update layout gate either way it is placed.  A
//    floating space(ymemory) object lands at the top of Y, between the stack and the reset-diagnostic
//    block; a fixed address near the base of Y leaves a hole that the stack is given instead.  Both
//    stop the stack from ending exactly at the diagnostic block, which the gate in buildtools/build.ps1
//    correctly refuses -- above that block the stack would overwrite the trap record on its way to
//    reporting it.
//
// So the Y-side operands are NOT declared.  They are addressed directly in the top 3.5 KiB of the
// region the linker already gave the stack, immediately below the diagnostic block.  Nothing is added
// to the image layout -- it is byte-identical to a build without this bench -- and the stack would
// have to grow past 18 KiB to reach it, which the run-time check below reports rather than assumes.
// This is a measurement device and is deliberately not how shipping code should get Y storage: a
// shipping Q31 front end must own its Y history properly, which means the gate and the linker script
// have to be taught about it.

// one.  X is 32 KiB and this application needs 37 KiB of data, so X is full either way; what differs is
// that the application's own .bss may sit anywhere and this may not, so asking for X moves 1 KiB of
// application data into Y rather than failing.  1024-aligned because the Y-modulo kernel runs an
// X-modulo over these, so their start address is a variable of the same experiment.

// none to give.  Before moving 16.5 KiB of polyphase table out of RAM to make room, ask the cheaper
// question: does the X-side MAC operand have to be RAM at all?
//
// On dsPIC33A a plain `const` lands in program flash with no startup copy (same mechanism the
// polyphase flash table uses), and 4.3.16 notes that X space "also provides the pointers into program
// space".  So MAC.l [w0]+=4 may well prefetch from flash -- at whatever flash access cost the core
// charges, which is exactly what has to be measured.  If it lands under the 1.5 cycles/MAC that 16
// channels need, the X RAM requirement disappears and nothing else has to move.

// ---- timing ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// One count is one instruction cycle (Timer2 at FCY, 1:1).  `min` over the trials with `near`
// counting the trials within 1/16 of it: with interrupts masked below, near should be essentially all
// of them, and a low near means something else is stealing cycles (DMA) rather than an ISR.
//
// Interrupts are masked around each individual timed call, for two separate reasons:
//
//  * It makes the reading an instruction count rather than a sample of a distribution.
//  * MODCON, XMODSRT/XMODEND and YMODSRT/YMODEND are NOT part of the per-IPL register context.
//    Table 4-2 lists W0-W7, ACCA/ACCB, RCOUNT and CORCON, and describes the Modulo Addressing control
//    registers as separate from the programmer's model.  So while the Y-modulo kernel runs with
//    XMODEN/YMODEN set, an ISR that preempts it and uses W0 or W1 as a pointer has ITS OWN accesses
//    folded into this kernel's ring.  That is a real hazard for running a modulo kernel in one context
//    while other contexts run, and the accumulator/RCOUNT/CORCON banking that closes the rest of the
//    ISR-safety question does not cover it.  The mirrored kernel programs no modulo at all and so has
//    no such exposure -- a reason to prefer it that has nothing to do with speed.
//
// One masked window is one kernel call: ~1-2 us at 200 MHz against the 84.9 us of TDM margin this
// build reports, so the audio path does not notice.  Masking the whole trial loop would not be safe.

// ONE TIMER TICK IS TWO INSTRUCTION CYCLES on this core, and getting that wrong halves every number

// the "instruction-cycle frequency" -- which is the classic dsPIC 2-clocks-per-instruction model.
// dsPIC33A is not that core: 4.3 states the CPU "can issue ... no more than one instruction per clock
// cycle", so the instruction rate is the full 200 MHz while the timer, clocked from FCY, ticks at
// 100 MHz.  Two independent checks pin it down rather than one assumption:
//
//   * The mirrored kernel issues taps+9 instructions -- 199 for 190 taps -- and cannot beat one per
//     cycle.  It measures 113 ticks.  199 instructions cannot fit in 113 ticks unless a tick is more
//     than one cycle, and 2 is the only ratio the clock tree offers.
//   * The existing telemetry converts these same ticks to microseconds against FCY and lands on the
//     333.3 us TDM window, which is 16 frames at 48 kHz.  So the tick really is 100 MHz, and it is the

/* ---- E-family half-band /2 kernel: measured block difference -----------------------------------
 *
 * MEASUREMENT ONLY.  Nothing here changes a live filter, a rate, or a default.
 *
 * WHAT QUESTION THIS ANSWERS.  The host CPU model
 * (recorded validation, candidate E) says that
 * replacing the shipping 41-tap /2 pre-stage with a 35-tap HALF-BAND prototype
 * drops 22 of its 35 taps as structural zeros and should save 10.69 us/block at
 * 12 channels.  That figure assumes the measured 1.012 cycles/MAC applies to the
 * shorter run too -- i.e. that the fixed cost per output does not grow when the
 * Y pointer has to stride two samples and step around the lone odd-index tap.
 * The model cannot settle that; only the hardware can.  So this probe measures
 * the BLOCK DIFFERENCE directly, which is the number the 500 us TDM chain
 * actually cares about, and reports cycles/MAC only as secondary evidence.
 *
 * It is not a filter design and makes no claim about the response.  The
 * coefficients are the same synthetic parabolic shape the rest of this file
 * uses, with the half-band structural zeros forced exactly to zero; the kernels
 * have no data-dependent branches, so timing is a function of the geometry only
 * and synthetic taps time identically to a real 35-tap beta=11 design.  The
 * SPECTRAL side of candidate E stays on the host, where it already is.
 *
 * THREE CANDIDATES, so the two effects can be separated:
 *
 *   DENSE41  the shipping /2 geometry.  The baseline the chain is measured against.
 *   DENSE35  the same half-band filter, run densely -- 35 MACs, 16 of them by zero.
 *            Its gap to DENSE41 is what merely shortening the filter buys.
 *   HB35     the same filter again, run by the half-band kernel -- 19 MACs.
 *            Its gap to DENSE35 is what skipping the structural zeros buys.
 *
 * DENSE35 and HB35 must agree BIT FOR BIT: they are one filter computed two
 * ways.  That equality, swept over every window start in the ring, is also the
 * correctness test for the thing that could not be reasoned about -- whether the
 * Y AGU's modulo folds correctly when an increment of 8 can step OVER the ring
 * end rather than landing on it.  The earlier M6 sweep only exercised increment
 * 4.  The sweep therefore runs on the shipping 209-sample ring, whose 836 bytes
 * are NOT a multiple of 8, and again on a 210-sample ring, whose 840 bytes are.

/* ---- Full-IIR precheck: six-SOS 48 kHz anti-alias LPF ------------------------------------------
 *
 * Phase-4 qualified a six-SOS elliptic LPF for the topology
 *
 *     48 kHz -> IIR only -> unchanged generic ASRC at step about 1.5 -> 32 kHz
 *
 * and estimated its cost as 6 x 25.7 = 154.2 us/block by scaling the Phase-3
 * FIVE-SOS measurement linearly.  That estimate is what this probe replaces: it
 * times SIX sections with the same kernel, the same 16 ch x 16 frame geometry and
 * the same placement, so the sixth section's real marginal cost is measured
 * rather than assumed.
 *
 * It measures the IIR ONLY.  The rest of the Full-IIR budget -- removing the N97
 * front end and moving the generic ASRC from step about 1.0 to step about 1.5 --
 * is not a kernel question and is deliberately not modelled here: it is measured
 * as the difference between two runtime images (APP_ASRC_RUNTIME_48K_TO_8 = 1
 * and 0) at A = 48 kHz / B = 32 kHz, from the same max_demand / pull telemetry
 * the existing CPU-margin study used.  Timing a bench replica of either would
 * answer a different question than "what does the shipping system cost".
 *
 * Like every probe in this file it is foreground-only, opt-in, touches no
 * streaming state, and never enters the audio path.

// SELF-CALIBRATION.  Every cycles figure here depends on FIRB_CYC_PER_TICK, and getting that
// constant wrong halves or doubles the verdict (it has flipped a conclusion before).  So the
// probe re-derives it from hardware in the same run: fir_ring_q31 costs `taps + 9`
// instructions for `taps` MACs, so its measured slope MUST come out at 1.000 cycles/MAC.  If
// the printed calibration is not ~1.0, every other line in this block is suspect and the run
// says so instead of being quietly wrong.

// The allpass coefficients are the host design's (K=16, split 6/5/5).  They are here so the

//
//   A  hand-written Q31 asm, 1 multiply / 2 state words per section
//   B  hand-written Q31 asm, 2 multiplies / 1 state word per section
//   C  the SHIPPING 96 -> 32 kHz front end, in the SAME measured window
//
// WHY PART 2 EXISTS AT ALL.  Part 1 (above) measured the C form and lost: 18.641
// cycles/section in Q31, 11.323 in float32, against a shipping front end priced at 110.0
// multiplies x 1.012 measured cycles/MAC = 111.3 cycles per 32 kHz output per channel.  Two
// things were wrong with stopping there, and the owner named both:
//
//   1. THE COMPARISON WAS C AGAINST ASSEMBLER.  111.3 comes from fir_ring_q31, a hand-written
//      REPEAT + MAC.l loop sitting on the ISA floor.  Part 1's kernels are plain C, and the Q31
//      arm in particular never reached the accumulator at all -- `(int32_t)(((int64_t)a*w)>>31)`
//      compiles to a 64-bit multiply and a shift sequence, which is why Q31 measured SLOWER than
//      float32 there.
//   2. THE COMPARISON WAS NOT APPLE-TO-APPLE.  111.3 is a MULTIPLY price for the FIR arithmetic
//      only.  It excludes the 41-tap stage's ring push, the intermediate 48 kHz buffer, the 2/3
//      phase schedule and the s24-left scatter -- all of which the shipping chain really pays and
//      none of which the third-band structure needs.  Part 1's 205.6/324.0, by contrast, already
//      included its commutator, branch sum and output store.  So the sign of the comparison was
//      not actually known.
//
// Hence kernel C: the shipping chain, driven by this same harness, over this same 16-output
// window, with its ring push and its intermediate buffer inside the timer.  It is the number the
// verdict is taken against, and it is the only figure here that can be compared to A and B
// without an argument about what is in whose window.
//
// ★ THE FINDING THAT CAME OUT OF WRITING THE ASSEMBLER, and it reframes the study: dsPIC33A has
// MIXED register x memory MAC forms.  `mac.l [w11], w4, A` and `msc.l [w11], [w9], A` are each ONE
// 4-byte instruction (assembled and disassembled to check, not assumed).  So a memory operand of a
// multiply costs no separate load.  Part 1 concluded that an allpass pays "four memory accesses per
// multiply against the FIR's two" and called that the structural floor.  On this ISA those four
// accesses are only TWO instructions -- the two stores -- because both loads ride inside the
// accumulator ops.  That is why kernel B, the deliberate counter-bet that halves the memory traffic
// by doubling the multiplies, is SLOWER than A in static instruction count (7.0 against 6.0 per
// section per channel) rather than faster: B saves one store and pays one extra sacr.l and one
// extra lac.l for it.  B is measured anyway, because instruction count is not cycle count when the
// load/store unit is the contended resource -- which was the whole hypothesis.

// ---- where part 2's operands live ---------------------------------------------------------------
// SAME arrangement, and the same reasons, as the FIRB arena above: a declared object in Y breaks
// the serial-update layout gate either way it is placed, so the Y-side operands are addressed
// directly inside the region the linker already gave the stack, below the reset-diagnostic block.
// Nothing is added to the image layout.
//
// The asm arms and the baseline OVERLAP deliberately.  They are separate arms of one console
// command, run strictly one after another, and each re-initialises every byte it reads before it
// reads it.  X and Y are both full in this profile (part 1's notes record that a second 2 KiB array
// does not link), so overlapping is not a shortcut here -- it is the only way both fit.
// * PART 2 HAS ITS OWN ARENA BASE, AND THE REASON IS A REAL HAZARD IN THIS PROFILE.
// FIRB_Y_ARENA is 0x11000, and in APP_BUILD_ASRC_CODEC_MEAS_HEADROOM_M30 the application's .bss
// ends at 0x11038 and SPLIM is 0x13DC0 -- i.e. THE STACK IS the region 0x11038..0x13E00, and
// FIRB_RING_POOL at 0x11000 sits exactly where the live stack is.  Part 1's arms never noticed
// because they use declared statics, not the arena.  Part 2's first attempt (2026-09-09 19:08) took
// the arena from offset 0 and died with a BUS ERROR at PC=840BE4, SP=0x117D8 -- the measurement
// overwrote its own return addresses.  The bench's existing headroom check did not catch it because
// `FIRB_Y_ARENA - (uintptr_t)&sp_probe` UNDERFLOWS when the stack is above the arena base, and it
// printed 4294966712 B of "headroom".
//
// So part 2 works DOWNWARD from the top of the region instead, leaving the whole low end to the
// stack, and it verifies that with a CANARY rather than an estimate (firn_p2_canary_* below).  The
// part 1 constants are left exactly as they are: moving FIRB_Y_ARENA would relocate every other
// arm's operands, and in this tree a placement change moves even an untouched stage by several
// microseconds -- their published numbers would stop being comparable.  The hazard is reported.
