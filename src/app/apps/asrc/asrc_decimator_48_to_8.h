/* IMPLEMENTATION CAPACITY of this legacy float decimator family -- how many channels THIS code
 * can process.  It is NOT an ASRC channel-width limit and must never be read as one.
 *
 * Three different quantities get called "channels" in this tree and only one of them may set the
 * width of ASRC processing:
 *
 *   ASRC_CH                 the ASRC LOGICAL width.  The only authority over how many channels
 *                           the front end, the history and the resampler process.
 *   APP_SLOTS_PER_FS        the PHYSICAL I/O width (WM8904 = 2 ch, I2S = 2 slots, TDM8 = 8).
 *                           Confined to the mapping at the two ends: replicate into ASRC_CH on
 *                           the way in, narrow to slots on the way out.
 *   this macro              THIS implementation's CAPABILITY, and nothing more.  It is not an
 *                           ASRC specification.  It may only take part in selecting or VALIDATING
 *                           an implementation; it may not change ASRC_CH.
 *
 * So the correct inference is NOT "float is 2 ch, therefore this path is 2 ch" but "ASRC_CH is the
 * requirement; this implementation cannot meet it; it is therefore DISQUALIFIED as a front end".
 * A disqualified implementation is not used at a reduced width -- the rate pairs that need a front
 * end are refused instead, with a reason (audio_app_asrc_rate_pair_is_supported()), and the pairs
 * that need none are unaffected.  There is no acknowledgement macro and no override, because every
 * such escape is a way of writing "reduce the width until it fits": a width reduced to fit measures
 * nothing, and for an anti-alias stage it is worse -- filtering fewer channels than the resampler
 * converts is a MISSING stage, and down-conversion without one is not correct at any channel count.
 *
 * This was not hypothetical: the AK128 TDM8 one-to-one notes in asrc_app_build_config.h used to
 * cite this macro as the reason the low-rate front end "cannot be used" in an 8-channel build --
 * i.e. a legacy implementation's capacity had quietly become a product-level capability decision.
 *
 * 2 is honest for THIS family: ASRC_DECIMATOR_HIST_LEN below sizes every history array by it, and
 * the frozen 48 kHz paths are byte-compared against builds that use it. Widening it is not the fix. */

/* den == 3: the 48 -> 16 kHz decimator, REPURPOSED 2026-07-29 to serve a 16 kHz OUTPUT.
 *
 * It was the two-stage front end for the 11.025 kHz path (69 taps to 16 kHz, then a 75-tap
 * decimate-by-1 stage at 16 kHz to reach the 5512.5 Hz output Nyquist).  The /4 respec moved
 * 11.025 kHz to den == 4, leaving den == 3 selected by no rate at all -- 6286 bytes of flash
 * and a boot selftest chain for code the audio path could not reach.  It now does what its
 * name always implied.
 *
 * ONE stage, and that is forced rather than a simplification: a 3:1 decimation to 16 kHz folds
 * at multiples of 16 kHz and the 16 kHz output's Nyquist IS the intermediate's (8000 Hz), so
 * every input above 8000 Hz lands inside the final band during the decimation itself.  Nothing
 * placed after it can separate frequencies already summed into one bin -- measured, a 75-tap
 * "repair" stage at 16 kHz moves the worst alias only -14.8 -> -21.2 dB (report section 12).
 * So this filter carries the whole job, with its stopband pinned on 8000 Hz, and it has to be
 * long: 161 taps, against 27 for the /4 chain's first stage, because den == 4 and 6 give their
 * first stage a huge transition band for free while den == 2 and 3 pay the full transition.
 *
 * Passband 5900 Hz (0.74 of Nyquist).  Stage alone -107.5 dB, cascade -116.1 dB, passband
 * edge -0.01 dB.  161 rather than the 157 the transition width alone suggests: at 157 the
 * stage alone is only -92.3 dB and the cascade cleared the gate solely because the
 * resampler's fc = 7440 Hz covers this stage's weak spot just above 8000 Hz.  That is real
 * but it is exactly the kind of downstream help a single-stage front end must not depend on,
 * so 4 more taps (1.1 us) buy the depth outright.  Priced against 137 taps / 5600 Hz and
 * 173 taps / 6100 Hz in recorded validation. */

/* den == 2: the 48 -> 24 kHz decimator, for a 24 kHz OUTPUT (2026-07-29).
 *
 * Structurally the same case as den == 3 above, and single-stage for the same forced reason: a
 * 2:1 decimation to 24 kHz folds at multiples of 24 kHz, and the 24 kHz output's Nyquist IS the
 * intermediate's (12000 Hz), so every input above 12000 Hz lands inside the final band during
 * this very decimation.  Nothing after it can separate what has already been summed into one
 * bin, so the stopband is pinned ON 12000 Hz and this filter carries the whole anti-alias job.
 *
 * Half-band specialisation -- the textbook saving for a 2:1 stage, ~half the multiplies -- was
 * priced and REJECTED: it needs the stopband to start above the output Nyquist and the resampler
 * to cover the gap, and the resampler's 30-tap prototype has far too gentle a transition for
 * that.  Every candidate from +-300 to +-1800 Hz around 12000 Hz needed over 401 taps, i.e. the
 * "saving" is a large loss.  See the HALFRATE_ block in
 * tools/asrc/asrc_decimator_48_to_8_design.py.
 *
 * 107 taps is the smallest odd count clearing -100 dB with the stage evaluated ALONE (the bar
 * the 16 kHz stage was held to, and for the same reason): stage alone -102.37 dB, cascade
 * -115.91 dB, passband edge -0.010 dB.  105 taps would pass the cascade gate at -108.32 dB
 * while the stage alone is only -92.41 dB -- exactly the downstream dependence this structure
 * must not take on.  Passband 8850 Hz = 0.7375 of Nyquist, the same relative width as the
 * 16 kHz stage's 5900/8000; RAM cost zero (the /6 member sizes the union at 190 taps' worth). */

 * Same arrangement as the /4 chain's 11.025-vs-12 kHz pair above, and for the same reason.
 *
 * 22.05 kHz differs from every rate handled so far in that it is NOT 48000/den: den == 2 is the
 * only integer choice whose intermediate rate (24 kHz) is at or above it, so the stage decimates
 * 48 -> 24 kHz as usual and the RESAMPLER then pulls 24000 -> 22050 at step 1.0884.  The
 * intermediate Nyquist is therefore 12000 Hz but the OUTPUT Nyquist is 11025 Hz, 975 Hz lower --
 * unlike the 24 kHz case where the two coincide.
 *
 * Reusing the 24 kHz set was priced first and FAILS: it is only -18.9 dB at 11025 Hz, so input
 * between 11025 and 12000 Hz walks through the stage and then folds into the 22.05 kHz band in
 * the resampler.  Measured cascade -24.70 dB, stage alone -19.74 dB against a -100 dB limit.
 * The resampler contributes only ~5 dB of that, so this set is held to the STAGE-ALONE bar like
 * the 16 kHz and 24 kHz sets, with the stopband pinned on the OUTPUT Nyquist, 11025 Hz.
 *
 * The tap count above is shared deliberately.  7875 Hz = 11025 - 3150 keeps the SAME 3150 Hz
 * transition width the 24 kHz set carries, and at a fixed input rate taps follow transition
 * width -- so 107 comes out identical, and the variant costs no extra RAM, no extra history, no
 * second ISR code path.  Selecting one is a coefficient pointer, loaded outside the tap loop.
 * Alternatives priced in recorded validation: 7500 Hz /
 * 97 taps (-5.0 units) is the fallback if the DSP margin does not hold, and a wider passband
 * costs taps outright (8000 Hz / 113, 8200 Hz / 119). */

 * chains unchanged and the composed ratio becomes /2 x /N (12, 8, 6 for 8, 11.025/12, 16 kHz).
 *
 * WHY.  The look-ahead one ASRC pull needs, R(step) = floor(step*(BLOCK-1)) + AHEAD + 1, is
 * proportional to the rate ratio, while the ring offers at most ASRC_FILL_TARGET_MAX = 104 frames
 * (FIFO 128, BLOCK 16).  From 96 kHz, 16 kHz needs 110 and 8 kHz needs 200, so asrc_set_fill_target()

 *
 * 21 TAPS, where a stand-alone /2 at this input rate costs 107.  This stage is the FIRST OF TWO,
 * exactly like the /4 chain's 27-tap first stage, so it inherits that structure's freedom: it only
 * has to suppress what would fold into the FINAL band after the remaining decimation, i.e. from
 * 48000 - final_Nyquist upward.  Pricing it with the stand-alone shape gave 107 taps at DOUBLE the
 * per-tap cost (its output is 48 kHz, not 24 kHz) and nearly produced a false no-go; see study
 * sections 6.1-6.2.  17.2 us instead of 87.7 us of a 166.6 us window.
 *
 * ONE COEFFICIENT SET FOR EVERY COMPOSED CHAIN, NO VARIANT ENUM -- the one place this is simpler
 * than the /4 and /2 stages it feeds.  Designed against the tightest rate in the menu (32 kHz:
 * passband 15000 Hz, which is the widest second-stage passband, and stopband from 48000 - 16000 =
 * 32000 Hz, the lowest fold edge), it satisfies every rate with margin to spare -- stage alone
 * -108.38 dB at 32 kHz's fold edge rising to -124.22 dB at 8 kHz's, passband edge -0.0001 dB.
 * Composed with each existing chain over that chain's own designed passband: ripple 0.0001 dB,
 * added droop -0.0001 dB, i.e. transparent in band.
 *
 * 21 -> 27 TAPS on 2026-09-02, to admit 96 k -> 22.05 kHz.  The widening was driven by a GATE, not
 * by a filter defect: the fill gate then in force (ASRC_FILL_SLACK_REQUIRED, retired 2026-09-12)
 * refused that pair on the direct path because the setpoint was pinned at R + ASRC_FILL_JITTER = 4
 * frames of slack, and a composed /4 fixed it by putting the resampler back at step 1.0884.  Under
 * the reserve law that replaced it (asrc_fill_law) the direct path is no longer refused for STARVE
 * -- it is held out of the qualified surface by the A1 fence instead -- so from 2026-09-12 this
 * row's technical justification is BAND LIMITING alone, which is what these taps were measured for,
 * and the row is what the pair runs on.  The old four-rate set could not be reused for that row -- at the
 * 36975 Hz fold edge it reads only -58.09 dB -- so the row and the coefficients go together.  The
 * set also covers 24 kHz, whose routing row is not published yet, because doing so cost 2 taps.
 *
 * 27 -> 41 TAPS on 2026-09-03, to admit 96 k -> 32 kHz -- and here the old set does not merely
 * lose margin, it FAILS: at 32 kHz's 32000 Hz fold edge the 27-tap set reads -47.95 dB, so
 * composing it would have shipped an audible alias.  32 kHz becomes the binding case on both
 * edges at once: the lowest fold edge in the menu (32000 Hz, under 24 kHz's 36000) and the widest
 * second-stage passband (15000 Hz, the L=2/M=3 `:audio` stage's own).  41 taps is the minimum that
 * clears the same -100 dB stage-alone bar, at -108.38 dB.  It stays ONE shared set because the new
 * design dominates the old one pointwise -- every other row's fold edge is above 32000 Hz and its
 * passband below 15000 Hz, so all six improve from a uniform -107.46 dB to -110.23..-124.22 dB.
 *
 * RAM +656 B (41 taps of mirrored, channel-interleaved history; +224 B over the 27-tap set), and it
 * does NOT join the union that holds the stages above: a composed chain runs the pre-stage AND a
 * second stage in the same block, so they need to exist at once. */
/* THREE COEFFICIENT SETS, WITH DIFFERENT TAP COUNTS (2026-09-03).
 *
 * The 41-tap set above is the SHARED one, and it serves every composed chain -- 96 kHz down to
 * 32 kHz and below, where a second stage runs behind the pre-stage.  It cannot serve the two rows
 * whose FINAL rate is 44.1 or 48 kHz: the pre-stage has to remove everything that would fold into
 * the final band, so its stopband edge is 48000 - final_Nyquist (25950 / 24000 Hz) and its
 * passband has to reach 20 kHz.  That transition is up to 4.3x narrower than the shared set's
 * 15000 -> 32000 Hz, and no tap count serves both cheaply: the shared set reads only -7.48 dB at
 * the 48 kHz fold edge and -15.54 dB at the 44.1 kHz one, while 169 taps would cost every
 * composed chain 4x the MACs for attenuation none of them uses.  So the FINAL rate selects the set, exactly the way it selects between the
 * two /2 and the two /4 sets -- with one difference that matters to a caller: THESE VARIANTS DO
 * NOT SHARE A TAP COUNT, so history and coefficient storage must be sized for the widest one.
 *
 * Each wide variant is a MINIMUM against the same -100 dB stage-alone bar as every other set
 * here: 111 taps reads -91.92 dB at the 44.1 kHz fold edge and 167 taps -98.72 dB at the 48 kHz
 * one.  Passband ripple 0.0001 dB, |H| at 20 kHz -0.0000 dB.
 *
 * A WIDE VARIANT IS NEVER COMPOSED.  Both serve a chain whose second stage is empty -- 96 -> 48
 * kHz, after which the resampler pulls 48 -> 44.1 kHz (step 1.08844) or runs at step 1.00000 --
 * so a wide ring and a second stage's rings are never live at the same time.  The Q31 front end
 * relies on that to give a wide variant the whole history arena instead of the pre-stage reserve,
 * and asserts it rather than assuming it. */

 * failed: at step 4.3537 the setpoint was pinned at R + ASRC_FILL_JITTER, leaving 4 frames of slack
 * where the servo needed 8, so audio_app_asrc_rate_pair_is_supported() refused the pair outright.
 * A composed /4 takes the step to 1.0884 (R 32, set 64, slack 32) and it is accepted.
 *
 * THE STARVE REFUSAL IS GONE as of 2026-09-12: the reserve law (asrc_fill_law) lets the setpoint
 * rise with R, so 96 k -> 22.05 kHz direct is starve-safe at set 99 with a full one-block reserve.
 * The pair is nevertheless still refused on the direct path, by the A1 QUALIFICATION FENCE -- A1
 * fixes starve on the supported surface and does not widen it.  What the /4 row buys is the BAND
 * LIMIT, so the row is unchanged and its reason is now stated once, in the taps paragraph above,
 * instead of resting on a starve verdict.
 *
 * 24 kHz still has no row here.  It used to escape the same refusal only via the exact-step
 * exemption (step exactly 4, floor == ceil) -- an exemption since deleted, because an exact step is
 * the WORST block-phase case and not the safest; it is now admitted on a real reserve like every
 * other row.  Either way it RUNS with no band limit but ASRC_POLY_FC of 96 kHz (44.64 kHz), i.e.
 * 12-44.64 kHz folds into its band.  The pre-stage coefficients above

 * The variant arguments pick the coefficient set where a stage has more than
 * one; each is ignored by the stages that do not.  `vpre` is the pre-stage's own
 * set and is read only when `with_prestage` is true.
 *
 * `with_prestage` composes the fixed 96 -> 48 kHz /2 stage in FRONT of the chain
 * `num`/`den` names, which is how a 96 kHz leg is served: the composed ratio is
 * den*2, and `den == 1` means the pre-stage alone (96 -> 48 kHz, resampler at step
 * 1.00000).  It is a separate argument rather than a wider `den` on purpose --
 * everything behind it stays a 48 kHz-input chain selected by the same divider and
 * the same coefficient variants, so the pre-stage is one more cascade stage rather
 * than a second set of rows.  A RATIONAL chain IS reachable behind it since
 * 2026-09-03: 2/3 after a /2 is the 96 -> 32 kHz row (composed num 2 / den 6), host-
 * and hardware-measured, and it inherits the 2/3 chain's partial specification
 * unchanged (`0-13 kHz protected / 13-16 kHz relaxed`).  Because a composed chain
 * then has THREE stages, dispatch is on `num` and never on a stage count.  `true` in
 * a build with no 96 kHz leg is refused, not silently dropped -- dropping it would run the second stage
 * at twice its intended input rate, which is a wrong filter and not a wrong rate.
 *
 * `vpre` names the pre-stage's coefficient set.  A WIDE set (FOR_44100 / FOR_48000)
 * is accepted only with `den == 1`, i.e. only when the pre-stage IS the chain: it
 * is sized to live in the second stage's history arena, so composing one behind
 * anything is refused rather than overlapped.  SHARED with `den == 1` is refused
 * too -- 96 -> 48 kHz with a 36 kHz stopband protects nothing above 24 kHz, which
 * is the whole reason those rows waited for a variant.
