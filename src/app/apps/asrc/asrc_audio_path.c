 * LEG B EXCLUSIVE CPU, and why the wall clock cannot be used instead.
 *
 * cbB above is leg B WALL time, and at a mixed rate pair it is not a CPU figure at all:
 * leg A is the higher-priority leg, so it preempts leg B repeatedly inside one leg-B
 * callback.  At 96/32 kHz that reads 994.6 us against a 500 us window -- obviously not
 * 994.6 us of work, but there is no way to tell from that number how much of it WAS.
 *
 * The whole-CPU question needs an exclusive figure for both legs, because the closing
 * condition is a sum: 3 x legA_CPU + legB_CPU <= 500 us at 96/32.  Until now the leg-B
 * term in that sum was an ESTIMATE (the 62 us in 3R + 62), never a measurement.
 *
 * So leg A accumulates its own measured spans into s_leg_a_busy_acc, and leg B subtracts
 * what accumulated BETWEEN its entry and its exit.  Nothing is timestamped per preemption
 * and no interrupt is disabled: the accumulator is a plain uint32_t written only by leg A
 * and read only by leg B, and it wraps harmlessly because only the DIFFERENCE is used.
 *
 * WHAT IT OVER-REPORTS, deliberately in the conservative direction.  Leg A brackets itself
 * from inside its callback, so its prologue, its epilogue and the dispatch around it are
 * NOT in the accumulator -- nor is any third interrupt (UART, timers).  Every one of those
 * stays charged to leg B, so cpuB is an UPPER bound on leg B exclusive CPU.  A budget that
 * closes with this number closes with the real one; a budget that fails by less than the
 * bracket error has not been decided.
 *
 * The subtraction is guarded rather than trusted.  If leg A somehow accumulated more than
 * leg B measured in wall time, the result would underflow to a huge unsigned value; that
 * case is COUNTED and printed rather than clamped silently to 0, because a fabricated 0
 * would look like the best possible result.

 * ONE CONSISTENT PAIR of (timer, leg-A accumulator), which is the whole difficulty.
 *
 * Reading them as two separate loads is wrong by a WHOLE leg-A block, not by a little:
 * leg A can preempt between the two loads, and then the timestamp is from before that
 * block and the accumulator from after it (or the reverse, depending on the order).  At
 * 96/32 kHz a leg-B callback spans not quite four leg-A blocks, so mispairing one of them
 * moves the answer by ~144 us out of ~650 us -- and since the result is PEAK-held, the one
 * block where the race happened is exactly the one that gets reported.  That was measured,
 * not predicted: the first version of this witness read them in sequence and printed a
 * 230 us peak where DSPload's own share put leg B near 74 us.
 *
 * So sample the accumulator on BOTH sides of the timer read and retry while they disagree.
 * A retry means leg A completed a block in between, which is precisely the case that would
 * have been mispaired.  The loop terminates because leg A cannot preempt indefinitely (it
 * is one block per 166.67 us and the body here is a handful of instructions), and it needs
 * no interrupt masking -- leg A only ever ADDS to the accumulator and this only ever reads
 * it.
 *
 * Both sample points are outside any leg-A block by construction: leg B is running, and it
 * only runs when the higher-priority leg is not.  So `steal` between two such points is an
 * exact sum of whole leg-A blocks, with no partial block at either end.

        // unreachable: a single 161-tap 3:1 stage, stopband on 8000 Hz, step 1.00000.  It cannot be
        // a cheap cascade -- a 3:1 decimation to 16 kHz creates the fold itself, so no later stage
        // can undo it (report section 12).
        // 24 kHz joined on 2026-07-29 as den == 2: a single 107-tap 2:1 stage, stopband on 12000 Hz,
        // step 1.00000.  Same forced structure as /3 for the same reason, and NOT a half-band --
        // that was priced and costs over 401 taps here rather than saving half (see the /2 block in
        // asrc_decimator_48_to_8.h).  It produces 8 frames per block, which the scratch buffer was
        // widened to hold earlier the same day (see DECIMATED_MIN_DEN above).
        // 22.05 kHz joined on 2026-07-29, and is the FIRST rate here that is not 48000/den: den == 2
        // is the only integer choice whose intermediate rate (24 kHz) reaches it, so the stage
        // decimates 48 -> 24 kHz and the resampler then pulls 24 k -> 22.05 k at step 1.08843.  The
        // output Nyquist is therefore 11025 Hz, 975 Hz BELOW the intermediate's, so it cannot borrow
        // the 24 kHz coefficients (measured: they leave the alias only -19.7 dB down).  It gets its
        // own set over the same 107-tap structure -- see the /2 variant block in
        // asrc_decimator_48_to_8.h.
        // Rates NOT in this table still resample directly, where the only band limit is
        // ASRC_POLY_FC of the INPUT rate (22.32 kHz from 48 kHz).  32 and 44.1 kHz are in that state

        //   32 kHz   -- worst alias 0.00 dB, folding 16-22.3 kHz down into 9.7-16 kHz.  Real and
        //               worth fixing; deferred purely on cost (every option priced out of budget).
        //   44.1 kHz -- worst alias -4.99 dB over a 270 Hz band at 21.78-22.05 kHz, i.e. inaudible.
        //               Not a to-do at all: nothing to fix, not merely unaffordable.
        //               LOWERING ASRC_POLY_FC TO BUY ALIAS REJECTION HERE WAS CONSIDERED AND
        //               DECLINED (owner, 2026-09-04).  The CPU cost really is zero -- fc is just
        //               another constant in the same 30-tap generation loop -- but zero CPU is not
        //               zero cost, and that framing is what made the first write-up unreadable:
        //                 - fc is ONE per-BUILD #define, not a per-rate value, so 0.465 -> 0.440
        //                   also costs the 48 kHz THROUGH path 1.81 dB at 20 kHz and 3.41 dB at
        //                   21 kHz (host-measured).  Below 16 kHz the change is 0.00 dB either way.
        //                 - so the trade is -5.7 dB of alias at 21.78-22.05 kHz against 1.8-3.4 dB
        //                   of flatness at 20-21 kHz.  Same top octave edge, near-equivalent swap,
        //                   not a free improvement in one direction.
        //                 - making it per-rate is not free either: the shipping preset is
        //                   ASRC_COEFF_STORAGE == FLASH, so each distinct fc needs its own baked
        //                   table (129 x 30 x 4 B = 15,480 B) and rows would have to be rebuilt on

        // 96 kHz leg A joined on 2026-08-02, and is the first row set whose front end is a CASCADE: a
        // fixed 96 -> 48 kHz pre-stage (shared set, 21 taps then, 41 today), then the existing 48 kHz
        // chain for the target rate, so the published RATIO is the COMPOSED one (num 1 over den 12 /
        // 8 / 6 / 4 / 2, or num 2 over den 6 for 32 kHz) rather than one stage's.  From
        // 96 kHz the direct step is up to 12, which needs R+jitter of 200 against a cap of 104 -- the
        // clamp that produces the audible break-up.  The pre-stage puts the resampler back at step
        // ~1.0.  See recorded validation part 3.
        //
        // 22.05 kHz JOINED ON 2026-09-02 (composed den 4), and the sentence it replaces was true when
        // written: "22.05 and 24 kHz are deliberately ABSENT here: their R+jitter from 96 kHz is 85 and
        // 80, both already inside the cap, so they resample directly and pay nothing for a stage they
        // do not need."  R+jitter against ASRC_FILL_TARGET_MAX is the HARD bound and still fits.  What
        // changed is the SOFT bound -- twice.  From 2026-08-24 to 2026-09-12 it was
        // ASRC_FILL_SLACK_REQUIRED = 8 frames above R with the setpoint pinned at R + ASRC_FILL_JITTER
        // = 4 at step 4.3537, which made audio_app_asrc_rate_pair_is_supported() REFUSE
        // 96 k -> 22.05 kHz outright.  Since 2026-09-12 the setpoint RISES with R (asrc_fill_law:
        // set = R_safe + one producer block + 1 = 99, reserve 17, inside the 104 cap), so the direct
        // path is no longer refused for STARVE.  The pair is still refused, by the A1 qualification
        // fence, which is a statement about what this image is qualified for and not about the ring
        // -- so this row's technical reason is now band limiting alone, which is what the widened
        // coefficients below were always about, and the row is what the pair actually runs on.
        // A /2 + /2 puts
        // the resampler at step 1.0884 (R 32, set 64, slack 32) and it is accepted.  The pre-stage
        // coefficients were widened 21 -> 27 taps for this row -- the old four-rate set reads only
        // -58.09 dB at 22.05 kHz's 36975 Hz fold edge, so the row without them would have swapped a
        // refused pair for an aliased one.
        // 24 kHz JOINED IN THE SAME CHANGE (composed den 4), for a different reason than 22.05 kHz:
        // the gate never refused it -- its step is exactly 4, so floor == ceil earns the exact-step
        // exemption -- but it was running on FOUR frames of slack (the exemption's whole purpose is to
        // allow that) and with no band limit at all but ASRC_POLY_FC of 96 kHz, i.e. 12-44.64 kHz
        // folding into its band.  den 4 takes it to step 1.00000 (R 31, set 64, slack 33), so it stops
        // depending on the exemption AND gains the `:24k` stage's anti-aliasing.  The pre-stage was
        // already designed against 24 kHz as its binding case, so this row cost no filter work.
        // 44.1 AND 48 kHz JOINED ON 2026-09-03 (composed den 2 -- the pre-stage alone, with nothing
        // behind it).  Neither was refused by the gate and neither had a fold to spare: they ran
        // directly at step 2.17687 and 2.00000 with no band limit but ASRC_POLY_FC, so everything
        // from their band edge up to 44.64 kHz folded in.  What kept them waiting was the FILTER, not
        // the routing: their fold edges are 25950 and 24000 Hz, below the shared set's 32000 Hz
        // stopband, where the shared set reads only -15.54 and -7.48 dB.  They now take their own wide pre-stage variants (113
        // and 169 taps, stage-alone -100.68 and -106.77 dB), which is affordable only in Q31 -- 36.2
        // and 54.1 us against 92.5 and 138.4 us in float, on a 140 us budget.  den 2 also puts the
        // resampler at step 1.08844 / 1.00000 instead of 2.17687 / 2.00000, so 48 kHz stops leaning
        // on the exact-step exemption and 44.1 kHz stops running on 18 frames of soft-bound slack.
// 32 kHz JOINED ON 2026-09-03 (composed num 2 / den 6), and it is the FIRST composed row whose
        // second stage is not a divider: /2 then the L=2/M=3 `:audio` chain, i.e. 96 -> 48 -> 32 kHz.
        // 32 kHz is not an integer divisor of 96 kHz any more than of 48 kHz, so a rational second
        // stage is the only way this rate gets a front end at all.  It waited on the 48 -> 32 kHz
        // N=97 AUDIO MODE decision (closed 2026-09-03: `0-13 kHz protected / 13-16 kHz relaxed`,
        // officially supported), because that same partially-protecting filter is what runs behind
        // the pre-stage here -- publishing the row before the decision would have meant changing two
        // places if the split had not been accepted.
        //
        // Its INHERITED SPECIFICATION IS THE SAME PARTIAL ONE, not a stronger claim: the pre-stage is
        // transparent over 0-15 kHz and removes what would fold from 32-48 kHz, so the residual in
        // 13-16 kHz is the 2/3 chain's own and this row is `0-13 kHz protected / 13-16 kHz relaxed`
        // exactly like the 48 kHz one.  A composed row cannot be better than its rear stage.
        //
        // Before this row it ran DIRECT and unprotected: step 3.0 clears the hard bound (R 61) but
        // only by leaning on the exact-step exemption, so it also ran on 4 frames of slack, and it
        // was observed starving on hardware (`hr=-12 set=64 step=3.00000 starve=4 fe=direct`).  den 6
        // puts the resampler at step 1.00000, which is the stability half of the reason for the row.
        // Unlike the 44.1 and 48 kHz rows it needs NO pre-stage variant: widening the shared set
        // 27 -> 41 taps covers every rate at once, and 32 kHz's 32000 Hz fold edge -- the lowest in
        // the menu -- becomes the set's binding case at -108.38 dB.  It read -47.95 dB at 27 taps,
        // which is why the row could not simply have reused them.
        // 32 kHz joined on 2026-08-23 and is the FIRST row whose front end is not 1/den: L=2/M=3,
        // num 2 / den 3, N=97, a polyphase resampling front end rather than a decimator.  It exists
        // because 48/32 = 1.5 has no integer divider, so before this row 32 kHz resampled directly
        // with no band limit but ASRC_POLY_FC of 48 kHz -- worst alias 0.00 dB (see the note below,
        // which is now half answered).
        //
        // It is AUDIO MODE / PARTIAL PROTECTION and must not be described as anything stronger: it
        // protects 0-13 kHz (host-measured worst alias -107.02 dB) and deliberately leaves residual
        // alias in 13-16 kHz (worst -25.50 dB, from a 16225 Hz input landing at 15775 Hz).  A strict
        // 0-16 kHz front end needs N = 161 or more and was priced out.
        //
        // BOTH LEGS, since 2026-08-24.  It was AB-only until then, on the reasoning that "32 -> 48 kHz
        // UP-samples, so it creates no fold to protect against".  That sentence is about the wrong
        // engine: the row a pair (A=32k, B=48k) needs is in the BA table, and BA there is
        // 48000 -> 32000, i.e. the SAME down-conversion the AB row exists for.  So the pair
        // A=32k/B=48k ran its 48 -> 32 kHz leg with no band limit at all -- exactly the worst-alias
        // 0.00 dB case this row was added to fix, just in the direction nobody measured.  Found by
        // the CPU-margin study: that pair read 80.4 % where its mirror read 99.6 %, and the missing
        // 19 points WERE the missing filter.  See recorded validation
        // recorded validation section 4.
        //
        // The "at most one ratio != 1/1" invariant still holds, and that is why this is safe to add:

 * THAT INTENT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENS TODAY, and this paragraph used to claim it was. Measured on
 * hardware 2026-08-25: a leg-B rate change takes audio_transport's FAST path, which keeps the
 * transport and codec A running and re-inits codec B alone -- and then calls the transport
 * client's reset_stream_state(), which is asrc_transport_reset(), which is this function. So
 * one callback is reached down two paths that make OPPOSITE claims about whether anything is
 * streaming.
 *
 * What that costs, stated precisely. It is NOT self-preemption: this runs at task level, so on a
 * single core it cannot execute while a leg ISR is in flight, and a source at the same IPL as the
 * running level does not preempt it either. What it does do is (1) update the two legs' IPC in
 * SEQUENCE with both legs' ISRs live, so between the two writes the priority map is neither the
 * old one nor the new one and an ISR accepted in that window sees a map no design step describes,
 * and (2) reset the ASRC stream state -- FIFO, ring pointers, servo -- while the producers and
 * consumers of that state keep firing. Note also that the setter below writes IPC WITHOUT masking
 * the RX interrupt, whereas the DMA HAL's ordinary reconfigure path masks the IRQ first for
 * exactly this reason.
 *
 * Build with APP_TRANSPORT_LEG_B_FAST_RATE_CHANGE=0 to force the leg-B change through the same
 * whole-transport restart leg A takes, which restores this precondition without touching the
 * priority logic; that is the A/B currently open on the stack-error question.
 * recorded validation section 19.3.
 *
 * APP_ASRC_RATE_MONOTONIC_ISR=0 restores the symmetric priorities for an A/B on the bench
 * without touching this logic.
