/* 96 kHz A->B bring-up.
 *
 * Physical transport: WM8904 96 kHz mode is I2S / 2 slots / 32 bit.  That is a
 * hardware fact, not a preference: SYSCLK is the 12.288 MHz crystal, the 96 kHz
 * register set uses CLK_SYS_RATE=128fs with BCLK_DIV=/2, so BCLK = 6.144 MHz and
 * a frame is 6.144M / 96k = 64 BCLK = 2 x 32-bit slots.  A TDM8 frame would need
 * 8 x 32 x 96k = 24.576 MHz, which this SYSCLK cannot produce.  ENA_96K_RATE
 * therefore resolves APP_USE_I2S_FORMAT=1 / APP_SLOTS_PER_FS=2 in the shared
 * config, and three #errors there enforce it.
 *
 * >>> THE 2-SLOT I2S FRAME IS AN OPERATIONAL ESCAPE FROM TODAY'S CODEC, NOT AN
 * >>> ASRC REQUIREMENT.  READ THIS BEFORE TREATING ANY OF IT AS A SPECIFICATION.
 *
 * Everything narrow about this preset -- 2 slots, one-way A->B, no BIDIR -- is a
 * property of the WM8904 that happens to be on this evaluation board.  None of it
 * is a property of the ASRC, of the DSP, or of the product.  Concretely:
 *
 *   - 2 slots exist because THIS codec's SYSCLK is a 12.288 MHz crystal.  A codec
 *     that can clock a 24.576 MHz BCLK carries TDM8 at 96 kHz with no ASRC change.
 *   - A->B only exists because THIS codec cannot run its own ADC and DAC together
 *     at or above 88.2 kHz.  A codec without that boundary is bidirectional at
 *     96 kHz with no ASRC change.
 *
 * So when a codec with a bidirectional TDM8 96 kHz mode is adopted, BOTH limits are
 * simply REMOVED -- they are not relaxed, negotiated or migrated.  Nothing in the
 * ASRC has to be redesigned for that to happen, and that is exactly the property
 * this comment exists to protect.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FORBIDS, therefore:
 *   - Do not design, size, measure or specify any ASRC stage against "2 channels",
 *     "one direction" or "96 kHz is A->B".  Those are transport facts with a
 *     shelf life, and an ASRC written against them is wrong the day the codec
 *     changes -- silently, because it will still build and still pass.
 *   - Do not let APP_SLOTS_PER_FS or the transport's rate gate reach any stage
 *     between asrc_push and asrc_pull.  See THE CHANNEL-WIDTH AUTHORITY in
 *     asrc_app_config.h; the physical width is confined to the two mapping ends.
 *   - Do not record a number measured at 2 slots as an ASRC capability figure
 *     without saying which of the three constraint families -- codec/HW, ASRC
 *     algorithm, or CPU budget -- produced it.
 *
 * The ASRC's own answer to "how many channels" is ASRC_CH, and it is 8 here for a
 * CPU-budget reason stated below -- deliberately NOT for a codec reason.
 *
 * Internal ASRC width stays 8 channels: the physical L/R pair is replicated
 * across all ASRC_CH channels by the established mechanism (asrc_push writes
 * p[c & 1u]) and only channels 0/1 are emitted to the 2 physical slots (asrc_pull
 * writes d[s] for s < APP_SLOTS_PER_FS).  This is the same "compute width wider
 * than the physical slot count" arrangement the 16-channel 48 kHz build already
 * ships; it gives a representative 8-channel workload over real 2-channel audio.
 *
 * Clock: A = ADC-only codec master, B = DAC-only codec master on its own XTAL
 * (B-XTAL -> B-MCLK jumper).  The WM8904 cannot run ADC and DAC together at or
 * above its 88.2 kHz boundary, so at 96 kHz this is one-way A->B and BIDIR is
 * rejected.
 * No PLL/clock-tree change is involved: only the codec's own divisors move.

/* 96 kHz -> 32 kHz, 12 channels, Q31: the whole recipe of the measured configuration.
 * Everything the 2026-09-08 dwell was built with is pinned HERE, so the preset is the
 * only thing anyone has to select.  Before this existed the same image needed ten
 * -Define values and one -AsDefine, and a forgotten one produced a build that ran but
 * was not the thing that had been measured.
 *
 * This block sits ABOVE the shared 96 kHz block below and every knob is #ifndef, so
 * these values win and the preset still inherits the rest of the 96 kHz setup
 * (ENA_96K_RATE, the runtime front end, the headroom instrument) from there.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT pinned: APP_ASRC_STAGE_PROFILE / APP_ASRC_LEG_PROFILE.  Both
 * default to 0 and the measured image had them off; a profiling build passes them on
 * the command line, which is how a probe build should differ from the shipping one.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A LOAD STUDY.  APP_ASRC_96K_LOAD_STUDY exists to lift the two
 * 96 kHz guards for a bench measurement, and this preset does NOT set it -- it is a
 * selectable configuration, not a measurement, so the guards name it directly in
 * asrc_app_validate.h instead.  The ASRC_CH <= 8 guard states a budget for a 96 kHz
 * leg B (a 166.7 us block); leg B here boots at 32 kHz, so the block is 500 us and
 * the guard's premise does not describe this operating point.

 * AK128 bi-codec bring-up profile.

 * Each ASRC object carries one physical TDM8 frame without the normal

 * 2026-08-20, at the AK512 phase count as well, with the coefficients resident
 * in program flash rather than RAM.  What each choice is forced by:
 *
 *   coefficients in flash  A RAM-resident table is s_poly[L+1][M] floats: 7.8 kB
 *                          even at L=64, against ~5.4 kB of data memory left
 *                          once the two ASRC objects and the four TDM DMA
 *                          ping-pong buffers are placed.  Flash is the only
 *                          option here, and it costs (L+1)*M*4 bytes of program
 *                          memory instead.
 *   L = 128 (AK512 parity) Purely a program-memory trade: L only sizes the
 *                          table (15,480 B at L=128 against 7,800 B at L=64).
 *                          It touches neither RAM (that is M and the FIFO) nor
 *                          the per-sample tap count, so the phase resolution
 *                          costs nothing in either.  Q43 measured the THD+N
 *                          floor at -127.7 dB for L128 against -106.5 dB for
 *                          L64, and the 108 KiB application region left by the
 *                          16 KiB resident bootloader has room for the bigger
 *                          table, so this build takes it.  L=64 is still a
 *                          supported geometry: set ASRC_POLY_L to 64 and the
 *                          l64m30 table is selected again (it is excluded from
 *                          this MPLAB configuration now, so re-include it).
 *   FIFO = 64 frames       A 128-frame ring would put the two ASRC objects at
 *                          10,112 B of RAM and overflow the part.  Note this
 *                          rules out the fixed-geometry asm producer kernels
 *                          (mchp_asrc_push8_tdm30_f32 has FIFO=128 baked into

 *                          mirror overhang carries this build.
 *
 * MEAS/capture stays out of the resident AK128 image.  The low-rate decimator
 * front ends did too until 2026-08-20; see the APP_ASRC_RUNTIME_48K_TO_8 block

   * 147/160: 160 phase classes, so the pull-start fill sawtooth is dense and its amplitude really is
   * about BLOCK/2, which is the 5 measured above.  A pair on a LOW-ORDER rational has q classes
   * spaced BLOCK/q, and when the phase slips one producer block the top class loses a whole block:
   * worst = set - BLOCK + (BLOCK/2)(q-1)/q, i.e. a FULL block at q = 1.  So "the worst pull is 5
   * down, not 8" holds for 48 <-> 44.1 and does not generalise -- AK512 32 -> 12 kHz (8/3, q = 3)
   * measured 10 down from a setpoint of 64 and starved.  The lower reserve is therefore derived from
   * BLOCK now (ASRC_FILL_BLOCK_RESERVE), not from this table.  What this table still settles is that

  /* SLACK THE *ar PAIR GATE REQUIRES -- RETIRED 2026-09-12, and this ring keeps the derived value.
   *
   * This profile used to set ASRC_FILL_SLACK_REQUIRED = 7, reasoning that the required slack is
   * "the servo's worst downward excursion from its setpoint plus one" and measuring that excursion
   * at 6 on 48 <-> 44.1 kHz (the ADDENDUM below).  The measurement was right and the reasoning was
   * incomplete: an excursion measured on a pair with 160 block-phase classes is the DENSE-phase
   * limit BLOCK/2, and a pair sitting on a low-order rational loses a whole producer BLOCK instead.
   * AK512 32 -> 12 kHz = 8/3 (three classes) starved on 8 frames of slack for exactly that reason.
   * The quantity is now derived from the ring geometry -- ASRC_FILL_BLOCK_RESERVE = BLOCK+1 = 9
   * here -- and audio_app_asrc.c #errors if this macro is defined, so a stale override cannot sit
   * here doing nothing.  See asrc_fill_law() and
   * recorded validation.
   *
   * WHAT THAT COSTS THIS RING, and it is not nothing: FIFO 64 with block 8 has
   * ASRC_FILL_TARGET_MAX = 44, so six pairs whose required setpoint lands at 45-47 are refused
   * where the old gate accepted them -- 22.05 -> 8, 24 -> 8, 32 -> 11.025, 44.1 -> 16, 48 -> 16 and
   * 96 -> 32 kHz.  THREE of those (24 -> 8, 48 -> 16, 96 -> 32) fail this profile's OWN retired
   * constant of 7 once R is corrected to the nominal-integer form, i.e. they were accepted only
   * because the old R under-counted by one frame; the other three fail only the full-block reserve.
   * Every remaining pair keeps its verdict and gains 1-2 frames of setpoint (see
   * the offline A1 reserve analysis).  Whether this ring wants those six back -- by
   * measurement on hardware, or by declaring a smaller reserve with a transport argument for why a
   * producer block cannot be deferred here -- is an open AK128 question, not something to answer by
   * restoring a constant whose premise was the dense-phase limit.

  /* CONSUMER BLOCK LENGTH -- the low-rate reach knob on this compact ring.
   *
   * One pull drains a whole block with the producer's ISR locked out, so it needs
   *   R(step) = floor( step * (APP_BLOCK_FRAMES - 1) ) + ASRC_POLY_AHEAD + 1
   * frames of look-ahead at its start, and R has to stay under the producer's overflow
   * guard ASRC_FIFO_FRAMES-4 = 60.  With the fleet default of 16 that caps this ring at
   * fs_in < 3*fs_out: 22.05 kHz against a 48 kHz peer, but NOT 16/12/11.025/8 kHz.
   * Halving the block halves the rd advance one pull makes, so it halves R:
   *
   *     out rate    step     R(16)   R(8)   guard   fill target max
   *     16000       3.0000     61      37     60     40 (16) / 48 (8)

   *      8000       6.0000    106      58     60
   *
   * Deepening the ring instead is not available here: 64 -> 128 frames costs
   * 64 x ASRC_CH x 4 B x 2 engines = 4096 B of data memory and only ~3.5 KB is free.
   * A decimating front end (the AK512 answer, APP_ASRC_RUNTIME_48K_TO_8) was ALSO ruled out here,
   * and that reasoning has since been corrected -- it is kept visible because it is the exact
   * mistake the channel-width authority in asrc_audio_path.c now forbids.  It read: "the float
   * decimator family carries 2 channels and this build is 8-channel TDM one-to-one, so both its
   * history and its ISR time would be 4x what that path was priced at."  A legacy
   * implementation's capacity is not a reason to drop a feature: the Q31 front end carries ASRC_CH
   * by construction at ~1 cycle/MAC, so the 4x was a property of the implementation that was
   * looked at, never of the feature.  Whether the front end fits AK128 is a question to be
   * re-priced against the Q31 family, not one already answered here.
   *
   * MEASURED on an AK512 board, 2026-08-20, this build at L=128/M=30 (block 8 built
   * with -Define APP_BLOCK_FRAMES=8; see the study report):
   *
   *     block 16                      block 8
   *     program 100,012               program 100,012      (identical -- no code delta)
   *     data    12,862 free 3,522     data    10,814 free 5,570   (-2,048 B: DMA halves)
   *     48/48 kHz  TDMsum 66.4 %      48/48 kHz  TDMsum 76.0 % margin 39.9 us, sat=0
   *     pull 81.1 us                  pull 41.0 us
   *     *ar0101 REFUSED               *ar0101 runs: fill 51..58/64 set=48! step 4.35390,
   *                                     miss=0 over 6.7e5 blocks, TDMsum peak 91.1 %
   *     *ar0100 REFUSED               *ar0100 runs: fill 58..59/64 (guard 60 -- no margin),
   *                                     step 6.00057, miss=0, TDMsum peak 84.5 %
   *
   * So the look-ahead wall is cheap to remove and the ring even GAINS 2 KB.  What block 8
   * does NOT buy is anti-aliasing: both directions still report fe=direct, i.e. the poly
   * cutoff stays at ASRC_POLY_FC of the INPUT rate, so everything between the output
   * Nyquist and 0.465*48 kHz folds back.  That is a listening decision, not a telemetry
   * one, and it has precedent -- the 22.05 kHz pair this build already ships and has
   * passed a listening test is fe=direct too.
   *
   * (SUPERSEDED 2026-08-20 -- the default is now 8; the addendum after this block records
   * the owner decision and the re-measured margin.)  Block 8 costs 72 us of TDMsum margin on the primary 48/48 kHz
   * configuration (111.9 -> 39.9 us) and that configuration is the one under listening
   * approval, so the trade is the owner's to make, not this file's.  Flip by predefining
   * the macro here or with a one-shot -Define APP_BLOCK_FRAMES=8.
   */
  /* ADDENDUM 2026-08-20 -- DEFAULT IS NOW 8 (owner decision, after listening).
   *
   * What decided it was not the low-rate reach above but STARVE on the Main profile.  At
   * block 16 the look-ahead R(48/44.1) is 32 against a setpoint of 36-38, and the pull-start
   * fill floor sits at R-1 -- the starve path itself enforces that floor, because a starved
   * frame holds rd and recovers the one frame that was missing.  So the setpoint could not
   * buy its way out: raising ASRC_FILL_JITTER 4 -> 6 (the ceiling this ring allows at block
   * 16) only halved the rate, 1.81 -> 0.96 /s on AB and 2.39 -> 1.43 /s on BA.
   *
   * Block 8 drops R to 23, which puts the floor ABOVE what a pull needs, and starve stops:
   *
   *     48<->44.1, block 8      AB: R=23 set=32 fmin>=28 (+5)  starve 0.00 /s  drop 0 /s
   *                             BA: R=22 set=32 fmin>=26 (+4)  starve 0.00 /s  drop 0 /s
   *     24 kHz                  clamp LIFTS (set 40! -> 38), starve 4.2 -> 0.02 /s
   *
   * Note the setpoint lands on ASRC_FILL_TARGET (= FIFO/2 = 32) at 44.1, not on R+JITTER=31,
   * so BLOCK is what fixed the Main profile -- the jitter slack below only binds where
   * R+JITTER exceeds FIFO/2, i.e. at the low rates.
   *
   * RE-MEASURED MARGIN (this build, with the fmin instrument): the 39.9 us above was taken
   * before it.  Worst observed is 27.7 us at 48/48 (83.3 %, bound 85.2 %) and 20.8 us at
   * 24 kHz (87.5 %, bound 90.0 %), sat=0 in both.  The owner accepted ~40 us; these are
   * tighter, so treat the low-rate margin as the number to watch if more load is added.
   *
   * Listening: 48/48 passed a full-length audition plus a deliberately awkward sine sweep,
   * and 22.05 kHz down to 8 kHz showed none of the grit the clamped block-16 build had.
   * 8 kHz is NOT qualified by that -- it is AM-radio material and still clamped here
   * (R=58 against a ceiling of 44); its handling is a separate discussion.
   * Evidence: recorded validation sections 14-15.

   * The float table is s_poly[ASRC_POLY_L + 1][ASRC_POLY_M] = 129 x 30 x 4 B =
   * 15,480 B of .bss, measured in the serial-update map.  That profile has no
   * spare data RAM (62,396 B of sections plus the stack fill the whole 64 KiB
   * region), so the identical bits are taken from program flash instead:
   * audio_app_asrc_poly_l128m30_flash.c, generated by
   * tools/gen_asrc_poly_flash_table.py for exactly L=128, M=30, fc=0.465,
   * window=2 -- the values resolved above.  The kernel arithmetic is
   * byte-identical; only c0/c1 change where they point.  Cost is about
   * +6.4 pt of the CPU window (flash reads are slower than RAM reads).
   *
   * Deliberately NOT applied to the M28 developer switch (no flash table for
   * that geometry) nor to the MEAS/96K presets, which are not RAM-bound and
   * would rather keep the faster RAM reads.
   *
   * ASRC_COEFF_STORAGE_FLASH itself is defined in audio_app_asrc.c, which is
   * fine: this is a macro body, expanded at the #if in that file, by which
   * point the name is in scope.

  /* F1(a), 2026-09-04: the *ag / ?ag control-variable trace is OFF BY DEFAULT in every MEAS
   * preset, and has to be asked for.
   *
   * WHY THE DEFAULT MOVED.  asrc_app_config.h defaults it to 1 because every AK512 MEAS preset
   * has always carried it, so every MEAS image paid for its Q34 buffer -- 16,384 B of X space,
   * the single largest allocation in the image -- plus ~4.4 KB of program for the two
   * printf-heavy trace bodies.  Nothing in a DR or THD+N run reads it: those go through
   * s_cap[] via *ac / ?ac.  It is a SERVO diagnostic.  The bill came due on the Q31 MEAS arm,
   * which does not link at all until the buffer is gone -- every Q31 measurement so far had to
   * be driven with an explicit -Define APP_MEAS_CTRL_TRACE=0 on the command line, which is a
   * default in the wrong place, not a build option.
   *
   * NOTHING IS LOST, AND NOTHING IS SILENT.  The exported symbols stay as stubs
   * (audio_app_meas.c's !APP_MEAS_CTRL_TRACE arm), so the console still answers *ag / ?ag, and
   * a servo-trace session is one flag away:
   *
   *     buildtools/build.ps1 -Full -Define APP_MEAS_CTRL_TRACE=1
   *
   * Say so in the report when a measurement needed that flag -- an image built with it is 16 KB
   * of X space away from the one every other measurement used, and on the Q31 arm it does not
   * build at all.  This is a measurement-only diagnostic, so it follows the same rule as the
   * rest of them: opt-in, never resident by default. */

 * Profiles that keep the SYMMETRIC RX-ISR priorities (rate-monotonic off).
 *
 * These nine had RM off before 2026-08-27, but not by anyone's decision: the
 * APP_ASRC_RATE_MONOTONIC_ISR macro used to be defined inside asrc_audio_path.c's low-rate
 * front-end guard, so every profile that compiles no front end left it UNDEFINED, and `#if`
 * silently read that as 0.  The macro now lives in asrc_app_config.h defaulting to 1, which
 * would have flipped all nine at once.  This block pins them back to what they were measured
 * and recorded under, and turns the accident into a stated choice -- the AK128 bi-codec
 * profile is deliberately NOT listed, because enabling RM there is the change this was all
 * about.
 *
 * The four MEAS / HEADROOM entries are the ones that must not move: RM asymmetry is precisely
 * what makes a per-leg wall-clock reading over-report, so every DR / THD+N / M30-vs-M32 number
 * on file was taken with symmetric priorities.  Flipping RM under them would leave the reports
 * describing a configuration that no longer exists.  The remaining five are pinned for the
 * plainer reason that nobody asked for them to change and no hardware has run them with RM.
 *
 * To qualify one of these WITH rate-monotonic priorities, delete its line here (or build with
 * -Define APP_ASRC_RATE_MONOTONIC_ISR=1) and re-measure -- do not edit a recorded report to
 * match a new number.  Listing them individually rather than reusing one of the shared blocks
 * above is deliberate: APP_BUILD_ASRC_CODEC_BIDIR and the three 96 kHz profiles share those
 * blocks and already ran with RM on, so a shared-block edit would silently switch THEM off.
