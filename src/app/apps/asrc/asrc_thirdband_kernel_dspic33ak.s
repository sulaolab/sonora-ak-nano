; MEASUREMENT ONLY.  Four hand-written Q31 kernels for the 3-path polyphase
; allpass 96 -> 32 kHz decimator studied in
; recorded validation.  Nothing on the audio
; path calls them; the only caller is asrc_fir_kernel_bench.c behind
; ASRC_FIR_KERNEL_BENCH_AVAILABLE.  Each entry point has its own code section so
; --gc-sections drops the lot from any image that does not enable the bench.
;
; WHY THEY EXIST.  The C form of this filter measured 18.641 cycles/section
; (Q31) and 11.323 (float32) on 33AK512MPS512, against a shipping front end of
; 111.3 cycles per 32 kHz output per channel -- i.e. the multiply count said the
; structure should win 6.9x and the hardware said it loses.  The diagnosis was
; that an allpass section pays FOUR memory accesses per multiply (load x1, load
; y1, store x1, store y1) where an FIR pays two AGU-incremented reads with the
; accumulator resident in a register.  These kernels test that diagnosis against
; the instruction set instead of against a C compiler.
;
; * THE ISA FACT THAT REFRAMES THE WHOLE QUESTION.  dsPIC33A has MIXED
; register x memory MAC forms -- `mac.l [w11], w4, A` and `msc.l [w11], [w9], A`
; both assemble to ONE 4-byte instruction (verified in the object file, not
; assumed; the probe log is in the report).  So a memory operand of a multiply
; costs NO separate load instruction.  The consequence is that "four memory
; accesses per multiply" is NOT four instructions: only the two STORES cost an
; instruction, and the two loads ride inside `lac.l [w9++], A` and
; `msc.l [w11], [w9], A` for free.  That is why kernel B below -- the deliberate
; "halve the memory traffic, double the multiplies" counter-bet -- comes out
; SLOWER than A in static instruction count rather than faster.
;
; THE TWO STRUCTURES
;
;   A   1 multiply / 2 state words.   y = a*(x - y1) + x1
;       Written as a = x1 + a*x - a*y1 so that both products can take their
;       memory operand in place.  12 instructions per section per CHANNEL PAIR
;       = 6.0 per section per channel.
;
;   B   2 multiplies / 1 state word.  v = x - a*s ;  y = a*v + s ;  s = v
;       Y/X = (a + z^-1)/(1 + a z^-1), the same allpass.  Needs two sacr.l and
;       two accumulator loads where A needs one of each, so it is 14 instructions
;       per section per channel pair = 7.0 per section per channel.  Measured
;       anyway, because instruction count is not cycle count when the load/store
;       unit is the contended resource -- which is the entire hypothesis.
;
; * SPLIT PRODUCTS ARE NOT BIT-EXACT WITH ONE PRODUCT OF THE DIFFERENCE.
; mchp_asrc_q31_row16.s records the measurement: on this silicon a fractional
; mac.l does not contribute the full 64-bit product, so `a*x - a*y1` lands 1..2
; LSB low against `a*(x - y1)`.  Kernel A takes that deliberately -- at Q31 two
; LSB is -180 dBFS and the alias floor being bought is -110 dBc -- and the bench
; gates on a double reference with a tolerance far above it.  A shipping version
; of this filter would have to re-qualify the rounding, which is noted in the
; report rather than papered over here.
;
; PLACEMENT IS PART OF THE MEASUREMENT (DS70005591C 4.3.17).  In
; `msc.l [w11], [w9], A` the two operands must live in DIFFERENT data spaces or
; both reads serialise and the instruction silently costs an extra cycle -- the
; same 1.012 -> 2.000 cycles/MAC trap the FIR kernels document.  The caller must
; therefore put the COEFFICIENTS IN X and the STATE IN Y.  The bench prints both
; addresses and refuses to believe its own numbers if they are not split.
;
; MODULO IS BRACKETED OFF, not merely unused.  MODCON/XMODSRT/YMODSRT are not
; part of the per-IPL register context, so a window opened by
; fir_ring_q31_ymod_yonly_block is open in every context.  These kernels address
; Y through the MAC AGU and so would inherit it.  They save MODCON, disable
; modulo in both AGUs, and restore what they found -- four instructions per CALL,
; i.e. per measured block, not per section.
;
; The .size directives are load-bearing: tools/asrc/ymod_safety_gate.py
; attributes any instruction outside every sized symbol to the nearest preceding
; label, so an unsized kernel absorbs whatever the linker places after it.

; The channel count is the shipping 16 and the interleave IS the point: two channels are
; processed together so that every accumulator and every AGU register is written at least
; one instruction before it is read, which is what keeps the body free of assembler-
; inserted neops (verified in the disassembly).  A single-channel version of the same

;
; The input is re-read every frame and the output overwritten every frame, which is what
