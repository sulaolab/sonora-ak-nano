 * Drain from inside a long blocking console write.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The periodic telemetry report is one uninterrupted foreground operation:
 * write() blocks per byte on UART1 (43.4 us at 230400) plus a blocking UART2 mirror, and at
 * 94 % ISR load the foreground only gets the gaps between block ISRs, so the report stretches
 * well past its baud-rate cost -- 105 ms of wall time measured on target for ~590 characters,
 * against 31 ms for the same report at 84 % load. Draining once per main-loop pass therefore
 * means not draining for that whole span.
 *
 * That is enough to overrun leg A: 256 slots at its fs/16 = 3 kHz capture rate hold 85.3 ms.
 * Leg B holds 128 ms at 2 kHz and never overran, which is exactly the A-only, higher-load-only
 * asymmetry the counter showed. Per-chunk draining bounds the gap to a fraction of a line, so
 * the fix is where the stall is and changes no capture cadence, EMA constant or servo term.
 *
 * SINGLE-CONSUMER INVARIANT. ccpdet_process_periods() is the only consumer and must stay the
 * only one. s_in_drain covers the whole body, so an ISR-context printf that lands mid-drain
 * skips instead of becoming a second consumer; one that lands outside a drain cannot race a
 * consumer that is not running.
 *
 * THE ENABLED TEST IS NOT AN OPTIMISATION. The first ccpdet_process_periods() call is what
 * discards the boot backlog and starts the queue. That decision belongs to
 * asrc_clock_control_tick(); a boot banner printf must not be able to move the start of the
 * measurement window, so this hook returns until the tick has made it.

 * ASRC owns these vectors directly instead of entering the callback-oriented

 * callback lookup, no instance table walk, and no floating-point context save.
 *
 * They now say that through the HAL's _hot fast path instead of poking CCPxSTAT /
 * CCPxBUF / IFS1. The instance is a literal, so the accessors constant-fold to the
 * same direct SFR accesses this loop used to write out by hand -- measured
 * identical at 240 bytes / 73 instructions / 0 calls before and after. The object
 * code is the point of a fast path; naming the chip here never was.
 *
 * WHY `context` AND NOT `no_auto_psv`
 * ----------------------------------
 * `context` says "do not save W0-W7 on entry -- the hardware already gave this ISR its
 * own copies". On dsPIC33A that is a statement of fact, not an optimisation gamble.
 * DS70005591D (Alternate Working Register Arrays): the CPU implements up to seven
 * alternate W0-W7 arrays plus AccA/AccB/RCOUNT and the DSP CORCON bits, and "each
 * Alternate W array is INHERENTLY assigned to a respective IPL (e.g., IPL4 is assigned
 * to Context 4)". Inherent -- there is no register to program and no way to forget. The
 * switch happens on exception entry and unwinds on RETFIE. It was also observed directly:
 * a debugger-frozen trap capture on this board showed SR.CTX == SR.IPL == 5, i.e. entry
 * into these very vectors had already switched banks.
 *
 * So the six `mov.l wN,[w15++]` pushes the compiler emitted for W0-W5 here were saving
 * registers that no longer needed saving. Both handlers are leaf after inlining and touch
 * nothing outside W0-W7, so `context` removes every one of them and the ISR gets shorter
 * as well as narrower. Precedent in this repo: _PWM5..8Interrupt in
 * src/app/apps/classic/classic_audio_pwm.c.
 *
 * SAFE DESPITE SHARING ONE BANK. CCP1 and CCP2 are both armed at IRQ priority 5 (see
 * ccpdet_arm below), so both run in CTX5. Equal priority means neither can preempt the
 * other, so they cannot be live in that bank at the same time. If either priority is ever
 * changed, changing only ONE of them is still fine -- what would NOT be fine is declaring
 * `context` on a handler that can preempt another handler at its own IPL, which the
 * architecture does not permit anyway.
 *
 * IT IS ALSO THE ADOPTED WORKAROUND FOR AN A1 SILICON DEFECT. DO NOT REVERT THESE TWO
 * ATTRIBUTES. The long-unexplained STACK ERROR trap on dsPIC33AK512MPS512 rev A1
 * (DEVREV=0x01) is caused by these pushes, and removing them is what stops it. Measured
 * on this board 2026-08-26 with a controlled A/B, both images identical except for the two
 * attributes here (report section 21.11 / 21.12):
 *
 *   `context`      (no pushes, 48 instructions):  70 stress cycles / 29 min, zero traps
 *   `no_auto_psv`  (6 pushes,  70 instructions):  trap at cycle 16 / 6 min, and again after
 *
 * The recurrence reproduced the original fingerprint exactly -- STK-SR=0x000500A1
 * (CTX=5 IPL=5 RA=0), INTTREG=0x00002C05 VEC=5 ILR=11, ~1.8 kB of SPLIM headroom, and a
 * stacked PC of <CCP ISR>+0, which in that build is the FIRST `mov.l wN,[w15++]`. Note
 * what the numbers rule out: with 1.8 kB to spare it is not stack exhaustion, and RA=0
 * retired the REPEAT hypothesis. It is not in the errata (DS80001162E rev E has no
 * stack/STKERR/SPLIM/W15 entry at all).
 *
 * So this is a silicon workaround wearing the clothes of an optimisation. If a future
 * reader "cleans up" the attribute back to `no_auto_psv` because the ISRs look like they
 * do not need `context`, the STACK ERROR comes back -- it took weeks to localise.
 * app_silicon.{c,h} prints the die revision in the boot banner so any log can be checked
 * against this note; A2 has not been tested yet (owner: a spare AK512 at a later date).
 * NOT declared `context`: the trap handlers in app_traps.c would be wrong to rely on it,
 * because traps "execute in whatever register context the CPU was in prior to the trap
 * event" (same section) -- they get away with it only because they reset the device.
