 *   #define APP_BUILD_STD_DEMO_1 (1)  / * tier: normal; artifact: classic1; display: Classic 1 * /
 *
 * tier: normal|advanced|internal
 *   How widely the preset is offered (see below). A preset without a marker is
 *   reported as 'unclassified' and hidden from every list - it is never silently
 *   treated as normal.
 *
 * artifact: <lower-case token>
 *   The stable filename token for this profile's serial update package
 *   (artifacts/serial_update_packages/sonora_<artifact>_<timestamp>.sfb). Lower
 *   case letters, digits and underscore only, unique across profiles. Declared
 *   here rather than abbreviated by a script, so that renaming a display name
 *   never renames files. Building a serial update package for a profile with no
 *   artifact tag is refused rather than given an ambiguous name.
 *
 * display: <free text>
 *   What the interactive menus call this profile. The APP_BUILD_* name is an
 *   internal identifier and is not what a user should have to choose from.
 *
 * normal:
 *   Standard user-facing presets.
 *   Shown in the default interactive preset list.
 *   Included in the regular smoke-test scope.
 *
 * advanced:
 *   User-facing presets for specialized hardware or use cases.
 *   Hidden from the default interactive preset list (switch_config.ps1
 *   -Advanced shows them).
 *   Included in the supported build scope.
 *
 * internal:
 *   Developer, measurement, reproduction, load-check and fault-isolation
 *   presets.
 *   Hidden from the default interactive preset list (switch_config.ps1 -All
 *   shows them).
 *   Outside the regular smoke-test contract, so one may temporarily fail to
 *   build during development. Naming it explicitly with -Preset always works.
 *
 * Tier says nothing about which application a preset belongs to, and nothing
 * about per-device availability (see src/app_specific_config_defs.h).
