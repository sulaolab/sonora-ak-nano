/*
 * nora_dma.h
 * NORA DMA HAL public interface.
 *
 * Portability scope:
 *   This interface minimizes application changes between NORA-supported
 *   dsPIC33AK board ports. It is not a universal, arbitrary-processor
 *   DMA HAL: channel inventory, trigger-to-hardware mapping, address-window
 *   rules, and register behavior remain properties of the selected NORA port
 *   and backend.
 *
 * Clean low-level DMA abstraction currently used by SPI/I2S/TDM consumers.
 * Channel ownership is a consumer/project-config decision, not a HAL policy;
 * a system enabling multiple DMA users must assign non-overlapping channels.
 *
 * Design boundaries (intentional)
 * -------------------------------
 *  - Knows no SPI register layout or SPI/audio transfer policy; no PWM, DSP,
 *    printf, or application code.
 *  - Contains NO ping-pong / block-streaming policy.  Ping-pong audio policy
 *    belongs later under audio (e.g. tdm_audio_dma_stream), which configures a
 *    channel through this HAL and decides what to do with each half/buffer.
 *  - The caller owns the DMA buffers; this HAL only takes addresses.
 *  - No callback framework: the DMA ISRs stay in the consumer modules.  The
 *    current SPI/I2S/TDM consumer owns its interrupt handlers.
 *
 * Not generalized (no current user needs it): scatter-gather, linked
 * descriptors, match mode, peripheral-chained channels (PCHEN/PPEN), runtime
 * channel allocation, OS integration.
