/*
 * dsPIC33AK-only part of the Clock HAL: the CLKGEN blocks, the register capture,
 * and the backend's diagnostic codes.
 *
 * WHY THIS HEADER EXISTS
 *   CLKGEN is not a clock concept, it is a dsPIC33AK BLOCK. The AK clock tree is a
 *   fan-out: two PLLs feed a set of numbered CLKGEN generators, each with its own
 *   source select and divider, and each feeding a different consumer (CLKGEN1 is
 *   the CPU's, CLKGEN13 is the CCP/SCCP time base, ...). dsPIC33C/CK has no such
 *   block at all -- it has one system PLL switched by OSCCON.OSWEN, and peripheral
 *   clocks are per-peripheral selects owned by those peripherals' own HALs
 *   (e.g. UART BCLKSEL).
 *
 *   So there is no CK implementation of these calls to write, and there never will
 *   be. Leaving them on nora_clock.h made that header look portable while its only
 *   entry point was AK-shaped. Naming them nora_clock_dspic33ak_* puts the fact at
 *   every call site instead: board code that programs a CLKGEN is AK-specific and
 *   should read that way, and board code that only needs "what is Fcy" or "switch
 *   the system clock" uses the portable face in nora_clock.h and ports as-is.
 *
 * WHO MAY INCLUDE THIS
 *   Board / platform bring-up that genuinely owns the AK clock tree
 *   (board/clock/, the resident engine's boot platform, UART board wiring).
 *   Application and DSP code must not: if application code needs a frequency, it
 *   wants nora_clock_get_fcy_hz().

 * Configure a supported CLKGEN instance from a logical source and divider.
 *
 * Configuring CLKGEN1 also changes what nora_clock_get_fosc_hz() reports, because
 * on this family CLKGEN1's output IS the system clock: Fosc = source / divide_by.
 * The frequency is derived from what the HAL knows about that source (the contract's
 * FRC frequency, a PLL read back from its own registers, or a frequency a caller
 * declared); for a source it was never told, Fosc reads back as 0 (unknown) rather
 * than guessed. Declare it with nora_clock_switch_source() if a caller ever needs
 * that case.
 *
 * CLKGEN1 is routed through the same system-clock switch sequence as
 * nora_clock_switch_source() -- it does not clear the generator's enable to change
 * its source, because CLKGEN1 is clocking the CPU that is executing this call.
 * The other generators use the general sequence, which does.
 *
 * NOTE that this call re-sources CLKGEN1 as well as re-dividing it, and does not

 * Change the system clock's divider, leaving its source alone.
 *
 * This exists because nora_clock_switch_source() no longer touches it. The portable
 * call used to force this divider to /1 as a side effect, which made a portable
 * operation carry an AK-only policy -- CK has no writable equivalent for the sources
 * that API exposes. The two halves are now separate, and this is the AK-only half:
 *
 *     nora_clock_switch_source()                -> system source, portable
 *     nora_clock_dspic33ak_system_divider_set() -> system divider, AK only
 *
 * A caller that needs both states which order its transition requires. Moving to a
 * slower source before lowering the divider is safe; the reverse can overshoot, which
 * is why this call and the switch each refuse a resulting Fosc above what this
 * backend will select (NORA_CLOCK_ERR_INVALID_ARG, with a diagnostic code).
 *
 * That check needs the current source's frequency, and when this HAL has not been told
 * it, the check is skipped rather than turned into a refusal -- matching the portable
 * contract's rule that an unknown frequency is never itself a reason to refuse. An
 * unnameable frequency means this call cannot promise the resulting operating point is
 * legal; it does not mean the caller is denied the divider it asked for.
 *
 * divide_by is the true divisor, 1..: 1 and even values are exact, an odd value above
 * 1 uses the generator's half step. A value the divider fields cannot express returns
 * NORA_CLOCK_ERR_UNREPRESENTABLE rather than the nearest one that can.
