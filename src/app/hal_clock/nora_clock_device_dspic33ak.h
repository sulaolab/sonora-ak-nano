/*
 * Internal dsPIC33AK device adaptation.
 *
 * The public Clock HAL uses logical source names such as FRC, PLL_1, and
 * PRIMARY.  This layer owns the family/device-specific NOSC encodings used by
 * PLLxCON and CLKxCON, keeping raw numeric values out of the generic core and
 * out of public headers.  If a future AK device changes encodings or source
 * availability, that mapping belongs here.
 *
 * The mapping is needed in both directions.  Encoding serves a request; decoding
 * serves an observation -- nora_clock_get_state() reads back the COSC field the
 * hardware reports, and turning that number into a logical name is the same
 * device fact read the other way, so it belongs in this file next to the table it
 * inverts rather than as a second table in the core.
 *
 * WHY THE FILE NAME CARRIES THE BACKEND TAG AND THE SYMBOLS DO NOT
 *   In this tree an untagged name reads as portable, and this content is not: the
 *   encodings are one family's.  The file was called nora_clock_device.h, which made it
 *   look like a shared interface and reserved the obvious name for a backend that has
 *   no claim on it -- another device adaptation is a sibling, not an implementation
 *   of this backend.
 *
 *   The declared symbols stay untagged because they are internal to ONE backend's build
 *   and never linked beside another's: a build targets one part, so one device table is
 *   compiled in.  The name a caller must not get wrong is the file it includes, and that
 *   one now says which silicon it is about.
