//===========================================================
// Public diagnostics contract for the native SPI/I2S/TDM transport. It exposes per-stream
// health counters and ISR load snapshots only. The dsPIC33AK TDMsum state and ISR fast path live
// in nora_spi_i2s_tdm_dspic33ak_diag_fast.h and are not part of this public contract.
//
// CONCURRENCY: counters are updated from the block-completion ISR. The 32-bit reads in
// *_get_load()/*_read_counts() are NOT atomic on this 16-bit core, so the CALLER must mask the
// updating ISR's CPU interrupt around them. The transport core already brackets its public
// readers with the DMA IE mask; these helpers do no masking themselves.
