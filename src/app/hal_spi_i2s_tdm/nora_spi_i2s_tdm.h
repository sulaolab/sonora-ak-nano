//===========================================================
// nora_spi_i2s_tdm.h = the public native SPI/I2S/TDM transport contract. Its dsPIC33AK
// implementation lives in nora_spi_i2s_tdm_dspic33ak.*. The same source is published standalone
// and vendored into the starter project and the CMSIS-SAI driver.
// It does: SPI framed-mode (I2S/TDM) setup, DMA + ping-pong buffers, block callback,
// start/stop/configure/get_status, and deadline-miss + load diagnostics. It is RATE-AGNOSTIC
// (no sample-rate state/API -- runs at the configured BRG / external clock). It does NOT do DSP,
// codec setup, or app config -- a client registers a block callback and a board/clock port.
// Pin/PPS + external-clock concerns are reached through the registered port (set_port()), with
// ONE exception: for a TDM MASTER with a 50%-duty frame sync (fs_shape = FS_50PCT) the _fs_clc
// unit drives CLC10 + a virtual pin (RPV8) directly to shape the FS pin; all other pin/PPS routing
// stays in the port.
// Compile-time stream geometry + topology come from a project-supplied
// nora_spi_i2s_tdm_conf.h. The HAL core only depends on NORA_TDM_* macros from that
// header -- it does not read app symbols. The publishable example config (conf.h_example in the
// HAL folder) is self-contained and app-independent; an integrator may instead supply a conf.h
// that derives NORA_TDM_* from its own build config (that is the integrator's choice, not the
// HAL's requirement). The core owns a dense logical leg table. Each descriptor row stores an
// explicit physical SPI instance plus its RX/TX DMA allocation. The default bank maps logical
// legs 0/1 to SPI1/SPI2; the explicit SPI34 test bank maps those same rows to SPI3/SPI4. Dense
// inst(i) accessors address logical rows, while spiN() searches the table for literal physical
// SPIn. conf.h also supplies geometry (SLOTS_PER_FS / BLOCK_FRAMES) and initial SYNC_DOMAIN seeds.
// The core's leg enum, buffers, leg table, and _DMA<rx>Interrupt vectors are explicit C keyed off
// those build facts (no generator macro). Supported-device limitation: the dsPIC33AK backend
// currently has silicon facts for AK512 and AK128 only; other parts need their facts added.
// Known sibling-HAL dependencies: nora_dma (required),
// and the load monitor's use of the NORA high-resolution timer public API (nora_high_res_timer_*,
// runtime-gated via is_initialized()) -- a clean sibling-HAL dependency, like nora_dma. The
// debug-only deps (<stdio.h>, nora_tick_timer.h for timestamps, board_dbg_pins.h scope pins)
// are included only under ENA_TDM_DBG, so the default (debug-off) core pulls none of them.

// TDM SLOT -- the element type of the block callback's buffers, and of the TX fill pointer.
//
// One name, one representation per backend, and the representation belongs to the backend:
//   AK: int32_t, transparent. MODE32 gives a single 32-bit SPIxBUF and 32-bit DMA
//       elements, so one sample IS one DMA element and there is nothing to pack.
//   A 16-bit DMA transport needs struct { uint16_t wire[2]; } so the wire-word layout
//       stays visible. Hiding it behind an int32_t buffer is how a half-swap defect can
//       remain hidden.
//
// This is the DMA contract's typed-value rule (nora_dma_status_t) applied one level up: the
// TYPE is shared, the LAYOUT is not, and a consumer touches the value only through the
// accessors below. It is not a portability facade -- no extra header, no conversion layer,
// no copy, no runtime cost. What it buys is that the block-callback signature is textually
// identical in both families while a portable consumer that writes `dst[i] = sample`
// still FAILS TO COMPILE on CK, at build time, loudly.
//
// The struct is NOT ported to this family and must not be: `int32_t` is the honest
// description of an AK DMA element. Sharing the NAME is not sharing the layout.
//
// THREE RULES FOR CODE THAT IS MEANT TO MOVE BETWEEN FAMILIES. All three are contract,
// not style, and all three exist because THIS family cannot detect a violation:
//
//  1. Go through the accessors. This family's typedef is transparent, so `dst[i] = sample`
//     compiles here and only fails on a family whose slot is a struct. The build that
//     catches the mistake is the OTHER one -- writing portable code here and discovering
//     it in someone else's port is the failure mode this rule exists to prevent. (An
//     AK-only consumer is not forced to convert; `audio_transport.c` does not.)
//
//  2. A slot is not a byte sequence. Both families are exactly 4 bytes and both assert it,
//     so memcpy'ing slot buffers between families, persisting them, or reinterpreting them
//     as int32_t COMPILES EVERYWHERE AND IS WRONG (this family stores a plain int32_t; a
//     wire-word family stores most-significant half first). Cross-family transfer,
//     storage and reinterpretation of the raw bytes are outside this contract. The DMA
//     status word needed no such prohibition because nothing tempts a consumer to move it;
//     an audio buffer is tempting, so the prohibition is written down.
//
//  3. Fold the conversion into the store/load the DSP already performs; do not add a
//     conversion pass. `for (i) encode(&dst[i], out[i])` is the shape the accessor
//     vocabulary invites, and it is the shape that costs: on a wire-word family a separate
//     pass measured 3-4x a conversion folded into the DSP's own final store. Here
//     encode/decode are the identity and cost nothing, which is exactly why an author on
//     this family cannot see the trap -- hence it is stated in the shared contract rather
//     than in one backend's comments.

//   job -- |y| <= |x| follows, so no overflow is possible and no saturation is performed.
//   gain_q15 == 0x8000 -> y == x in every audio bit.  gain_q15 == 0 -> y == 0, branchless.
//   Truncating, not rounding.  src == dst is safe.
//
// The two families differ in the LEAST SIGNIFICANT BIT of the 32-bit word and nowhere else,

// computing ((x*g) >> 16) << 1 from two 16x16 products produces exactly
//     y_wire == y_here - bit15( lo16(x) * g )
// so y_wire <= y_here always, bit 0 is always clear, and the difference is a truncation
// toward negative infinity -- not a rounding-mode disagreement that could go either way.

// is below the audio LSB of a 24-bit-in-32 wire word on both parts. Stated rather than
// hidden: a consumer comparing two families bit-for-bit will find this, and one-sidedness
// is what lets it conclude "declared difference" instead of "possible bug".

// to fill; user = opaque context. One callback handles exactly one physical SPI's
// RX/TX block -- there is no dst_b / "second output": when multiple instances run,
// each has its own callback. Cross-instance routing is application policy. It may use
// an application-owned handoff buffer, or the candidate co-clock mirror helpers below
// when one callback directly produces a co-clocked sibling's TX block.
// Contract: register it (set_block_callback) BEFORE start(); do NOT clear it while

// Contract: when this callback is invoked, src and dst are both non-NULL. If the core
// cannot resolve either half-buffer (reload boundary / just-stopped / first block /
// fault), it skips the block instead of calling the callback -- the callee never
// NULL-checks src/dst.
// src and dst are SLOT buffers (nora_tdm_slot_t, above), not raw int32_t arrays. On this

//   - set_block_callback(): register one instance's per-block event callback.
//   - open()/close()     : shared board/clock port bring-up/teardown (once for the

// DMA interrupt vectors: by default (NORA_TDM_DEFINE_DMA_VECTORS=1, conf.h) the HAL
// DEFINES the _DMAnInterrupt vectors itself (one RX vector per instance descriptor row),
// so the integrator writes NO interrupt/DMA code -- just registers a per-instance block
// callback. TX is interrupt-less (fire-and-forget ping-pong with auto-reload; hw.c
// enables the CPU IRQ on the RX channel only). RX/TX channel numbers come from conf.h and
// are baked in as compile-time constants so the DMA register access folds. The HAL-owned RX
// vectors are EXPLICIT (_DMA0Interrupt / _DMA2Interrupt for the default channels), each bound
// to its leg's conf.h RX-DMA channel by a compile-time assert -- so simply changing a leg's
// RX-DMA channel in conf.h fails the build until the matching explicit vector in the core
// source is updated too (the vector name does not auto-follow). To hand an IVT slot to another
// subsystem without touching the core, take full vector ownership: set
// NORA_TDM_DEFINE_DMA_VECTORS=0 (the HAL then defines no vectors) and call inst_rx_isr()
// below from your own _DMA<rx>Interrupt for each instance. (See conf.h_example for the same note.)

// RX-block ISR entry for one instance, for the NORA_TDM_DEFINE_DMA_VECTORS=0
// (vector-ownership opt-out) path: call it from your own _DMA<rx>Interrupt for that
// instance's RX channel (TX is interrupt-less -- never call it for a TX channel). It runs
// the same block work as the HAL's own explicit vector. A NULL inst is ignored. In the
// default turnkey build (=1) you do not call this -- the HAL's own vectors do the work.
