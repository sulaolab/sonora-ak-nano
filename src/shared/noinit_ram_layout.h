//===========================================================
// noinit_ram_layout.h -- who owns which bytes of the hal_noinit_ram block.
//
// hal_noinit_ram deliberately offers ONE accessor, NORA_NOINIT_RAM_AS(type), which
// overlays a type on the start of the block. That is all a single-tenant block needs.
// The moment there are two tenants, the carve-up has to be stated somewhere, and it must
// be somewhere BOTH tenants and the linker script can be checked against -- not inside
// either tenant, which would make one of them the other's owner.
//
// WHY THE TRAP RECORD IS FIRST AND THE PIPE IS NOT
// -----------------------------------------------
// The block was 0x13F80..0x13FFF with the pipe at offset 0. It grew DOWNWARD to 0x13F30
// (the only direction available -- it already ended at the top of RAM), so offset 0 is
// now new ground and the pipe's old bytes are at offset 0x50.
//
// The alternative -- keeping the pipe at offset 0 and putting the trap record in the
// tail -- would have moved the pipe's ABSOLUTE address, and that address is the one thing
// the application and the resident bootloader must agree on across two separately built
// images. A mismatch there does not fail to link; it silently reads the wrong bytes, and
// the pipe's own version/complement pair is what would (correctly, uselessly) report the
// container as absent. So the layout below is chosen to leave 0x13F80 alone.
//
// COLD/WARM IS EACH TENANT'S OWN BUSINESS
// ---------------------------------------
// Both tenants validate their own region with their own magic, so neither needs the other
// to have run. resident_boot_pipe_init() no longer zeroes the whole block for the same
// reason -- see the note at its zeroing loop.

/*
 * The pipe's absolute address is the cross-image contract, so it is asserted here rather
 * than left to arithmetic in two places. Each device's value is in a published document
 * (recorded validation part 3), not a free parameter.
 *
 * PER DEVICE SINCE THE AK128 GAINED A RESIDENT BOOTLOADER. The address was AK512-only
 * while only that part had a second image; now both do, and the pipe is at the top of
 * whichever data RAM this part has (block + 0x50, exactly as on the AK512). The value
 * asserted is therefore per device, and the point of asserting it is unchanged: an image
 * pair that disagrees here does not fail to link. It silently reads the wrong bytes, and
 * the pipe's own version/complement pair reports the container as absent -- correctly,
 * and uselessly.
 *
 * STILL SCOPED TO THE BUILDS THAT HAVE A SECOND IMAGE. The block itself is reserved in
 * every configuration because app_traps.c needs it everywhere; a standalone image has
 * nothing to agree with, so asserting an address there would only make a build fail for
 * disagreeing with a promise nobody made. The carve-up assertions above are
 * unconditional and are what keep the two regions honest in every build.
