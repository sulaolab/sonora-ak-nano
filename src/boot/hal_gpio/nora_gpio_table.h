/*
 * A board's fixed pins as a table, applied in one call.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR
 * ----------------
 * A board's user-I/O stage is a list: this pin an output starting low, that one an
 * input with a pull-up, this one analog. Spelled as straight-line code it becomes
 * one `if (!...) return false;` per pin, and the LIST, which is the actual board
 * fact, is buried in the control flow that walks it.
 *
 * As a table the fact is the data and the walk is shared. That is the same move the
 * app-layer seams already make one level up, and the point of it here is that two
 * boards' pin stages stop being two functions that merely resemble each other and
 * become two tables with one applier.
 *
 * SCOPE NOTE FOR THIS FAMILY. This file provides a declarative mapping when a board
 * needs one. This codebase currently configures two debug pins from one shared config, so
 * the table saves it no lines today -- it is here so a board using this API has a
 * family compiles against both, and so the next board added here has the seam
 * already. Nothing in it is device-specific: the backend .c is identical on both
 * families apart from its file name.
 *
 * A DELIBERATELY THIN INTERFACE
 * -----------------------------
 * No failure index is reported, only pass/fail. It was tempting -- a table makes
 * "which entry refused" nearly free to compute -- but the straight-line code it
 * replaces did not report it either and no caller has asked. Add it when something
 * wants it.

 * Apply every entry in order, stopping at the first refusal.

 * ENTRIES ARE INDEPENDENT, and that is a property worth keeping. The walk is top to
 * bottom because it is a loop, but no board's table may rely on it: each entry states
 * one pin completely (direction, pull, analog, open-drain, initial level), so applying
 * them in any order gives the same result. If a new board needs pin B configured after
 * pin A, that is a sign the pin descriptions are incomplete; fix the description
 * rather than relying on the sequence.
 *
 * (The CK copy of this header carries the history behind that rule: a board there once
 * cleared ANSEL across all ports at boot and had to re-assert its analog pin
 * afterwards, which only worked if that entry came last. The bulk sweep was deleted;
 * this codebase never had one, each pin owning its own ANSEL.)
