/*
 * Clock HAL public interface -- the AK/CK common face.
 *
 * This HAL exposes logical PLL programming requests, a system-clock source
 * switch, the authoritative current frequencies, and one observation of what the
 * hardware is actually running on.  It hides device NOSC encodings, XC-DSC
 * bitfields, and SFR names below the public API.  The generic core validates PLL
 * input, VCO, divider, and output constraints from its backend's device facts (on
 * AK, the dsPIC33AK512MPS512 DFP 1.3.185), then drives the internal register layer
 * that owns switch, ready, and timeout sequencing.
 *
 * Board policy stays above this HAL: FRC boot policy, PPS routing, REFI pin
 * selection, UART / PWM / audio clock requirements, and application frequency
 * choices belong to the board or peripheral integration layers.  No public type
 * in this header is an XC-DSC / DFP register type.
 *
 * WHAT IS **NOT** HERE, AND WHY
 *   The CLKGEN blocks moved to nora_clock_dspic33ak.h.  CLKGEN is a dsPIC33AK
 *   block, not a clock concept: CK has no such thing (one system PLL switched by
 *   OSCCON.OSWEN, plus per-peripheral selects), so there is no CK implementation
 *   of those calls to write.  Keeping them here made this header read as portable
 *   while its only entry point was AK-shaped.  Code that programs a CLKGEN is
 *   board bring-up and now says so at the call site; code that just needs a
 *   frequency uses nora_clock_get_fcy_hz() and ports unchanged.
 *
 *   A raw register dump is not here either.  Post-mortem and bring-up code that
 *   genuinely wants the oscillator control words asks its backend for them by
 *   name (nora_clock_<family>_raw_capture()), so the register set it depends on
 *   is visible in the type it names, and no portable-looking call returns a word
 *   whose bit layout is silicon.  Everything that is a *question* about the clock
 *   -- which source, running, locked, at what frequency -- is nora_clock_get_state()
 *   and needs no register decode at the call site.
 *
 * PORTABILITY OF nora_clock_source_t
 *   FRC / BFRC / PRIMARY / LPRC are oscillators every family has; together with
 *   PLL_1 / PLL_2 they are the values nora_clock_switch_source() accepts.  The
 *   remaining values name nodes that exist because of how one family fans its
 *   clock tree out; they live in a separate numeric range.  Some are
 *   nora_clock_pll_configure() inputs (AK's fractional-divider VCO taps and REFI
 *   pins, also used by the AK CLKGEN calls); FRC_DIVIDED is observation-only, like
 *   NORA_CLOCK_SOURCE_UNKNOWN.  A backend that
 *   lacks a value returns NORA_CLOCK_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED rather than silently
 *   accepting it.
 *
 *   Naming a source is not the same as being allowed to use it for a given
 *   operation, and this header does not pretend otherwise.  "Can the system clock
 *   run from it" and "can it feed this PLL" are different hardware questions with
 *   different answers on the SAME part -- on AK, LPRC can drive the system clock but
 *   cannot feed a PLL, while REFI1/REFI2 can feed a PLL and are not system-clock
 *   selections -- so there are two predicates, nora_clock_system_source_is_supported()
 *   and nora_clock_pll_input_is_supported(), and neither answers the other.  Both are
 *   compile-target properties and touch no hardware.

 * accepts, and on AK it is neither a subset nor a superset of it: AK PLL inputs are

 *
 * resolved_hz is optional and is written only after the hardware programming

 * SOURCE ONLY
 *   This call changes the system-clock SOURCE.  It does not implicitly normalize or
 *   otherwise modify a backend-specific system divider.  That divider is not a
 *   portable concept: on AK it is CLKGEN1's, owned by
 *   nora_clock_dspic33ak_system_divider_set(), and CK has no writable equivalent for
 *   the sources this call exposes -- so a portable call that quietly forced it to /1
 *   would be carrying one family's policy under a portable name.  A caller that needs
 *   both states both, in the order its transition requires.
 *
 * DIRECT TRANSITION
 *   The request is for a DIRECT transition.  The HAL does not silently detour through
 *   an intermediate oscillator or clock mode to make the call appear to work: a detour
 *   re-clocks everything else timed off this clock, and only the caller knows what
 *   that is.
 *
 *   Before touching hardware, a backend must reject the request when it can determine
 *   either that
 *     - the requested direct transition itself is prohibited by that silicon
 *       (for example, a PLL mode -> PLL mode transition that must pass through a
 *       non-PLL source), or
 *     - the resulting operating point would violate that silicon's clock limits
 *       (AK: selecting a ~798.72 MHz PLL2 output while the system divider is /1).
 *
 *   These are two instances of one portable rule -- do not begin a transition this
 *   silicon cannot legally complete -- which is why both live here rather than one
 *   being a frequency check and the other a backend quirk.  Both are refused as
 *   NORA_CLOCK_ERR_INVALID_ARG before the first register write, so a refusal leaves
 *   the clock exactly as it was.  nora_clock_last_diag() may identify the
 *   backend-specific precondition that made the direct transition illegal.
 *
 * SAME SOURCE = A DECLARATION UPDATE, NOT A CLOCK SWITCH
 *   If the requested source is already the one driving the system clock, there is no
 *   transition to perform, and this call does not issue a hardware clock-switch
 *   sequence.  It validates the request, applies any frequency declaration in input_hz,
 *   and returns NORA_CLOCK_OK.  Re-running a switch sequence onto the running source
 *   would be a real clock event -- a re-lock, a switch-completion poll, a window in
 *   which the part is neither on the old nor the new selection -- performed to reach
 *   the state the part is already in, which is a cost with no purpose and a risk with
 *   no benefit.  It is not an error either: asking for the state you already have is
 *   satisfied, not rejected.
 *
 *   "Already the source" is judged from the source the hardware is OBSERVED to report,
 *   never from what this HAL last programmed -- otherwise a clock failure monitor that
 *   moved the part elsewhere would turn a genuine recovery switch into a silent no-op,
 *   which is precisely when the caller most needs the switch to happen.
 *   NORA_CLOCK_SOURCE_UNKNOWN is never "the same source": a backend that cannot name
 *   what the part is running on has not established that no transition is needed, so
 *   the request is carried out.
 *
 *   Where a family folds "the PLL" into its source selection, identity of the SOURCE is
 *   not identity of that PLL's configuration -- the part can report PLL_1 while this
 *   HAL's caller believes that PLL is fed from a different input.  It is still the same
 *   source, and still a no-op.  Such a state cannot be produced through this contract:
 *   nora_clock_pll_configure() refuses to reconfigure the PLL the system clock is
 *   running from, so if it exists, something outside this HAL put it there and the
 *   OBSERVED selection is the authority on what the part is doing.  Re-issuing the
 *   switch to make the record agree would be the prohibited PLL-mode-to-PLL-mode
 *   transition above, attempted on a path the caller believes is a no-op, and taking a
 *   detour through another oscillator to make it legal is what DIRECT TRANSITION
 *   forbids.  A caller that wants that PLL configured differently switches the system
 *   clock away from it first -- the rule it already lives under.
 *
 * input_hz is that source's frequency in Hz.  Its classification and its declaration
 * semantics are nora_clock_pll_config_t.input_hz's, above -- 0 uses what the contract
 * already knows, a value equal to a contract-known frequency is accepted as a
 * restatement, a value contradicting one is NORA_CLOCK_ERR_INVALID_ARG, and a nonzero
 * value for a caller-declared source replaces any earlier declaration for that source
 * (including on the same-source path: an updated declaration is applied even though no
 * clock event occurs).  A zero never CLEARS a declaration -- "I am not restating it" is
 * not "forget it".
 *
 * AN UNKNOWN FREQUENCY IS NOT A REASON TO REFUSE
 *   Unlike nora_clock_pll_configure(), this call does not need the number: selecting a
 *   source is legal whether or not anyone can name its frequency.  If the frequency is
 *   unknown -- a caller-declared source never declared, passed as 0 -- the switch is
 *   performed, and nora_clock_get_fosc_hz() / nora_clock_state_t.fosc_hz then report 0,
 *   which is the honest answer to "what is Fosc" and the reason that 0 is a documented
 *   return.  A HAL that instead refused would be forcing callers to invent a plausible
 *   number to get a legal operation performed, and every frequency derived from that
 *   invention would be wrong while looking authoritative.
 *
 *   What an unknown frequency removes is only the FREQUENCY arm of the preflight above:
 *   an operating point that cannot be computed cannot be checked.  The silicon
 *   transition-legality arm is unaffected and still refuses.
 *
 * ON FAILURE
 *   The HAL does not deliberately disable the clock that is currently running the
 *   part: the system-clock path never clears the generator's enable to change its
 *   source, so a request that cannot complete fails as a returned status rather
 *   than as a stopped CPU.  That is the guarantee.  It is *not* a promise that the
 *   hardware is still selecting the old source on error -- a switch can be left
 *   part-way through by the sequencer, and a clock failure monitor may act on its
 *   own.  After any error, nora_clock_get_state() is the authority on what the
 *   part is actually running on; do not assume the previous configuration.

 * "A previous call" means through ANY of this contract's calls that name the source --
 * nora_clock_pll_configure() naming it as a PLL input, or nora_clock_switch_source()
 * selecting it -- because a declaration belongs to the source and not to the API that
 * carried it.  This function is the read side of that one store.
 *
 * Deriving a PLL output READS clock registers.  It changes nothing and does not
 * require that source to be driving anything, but it is a read of present hardware
 * state rather than a lookup of a remembered request -- which is exactly why a failed
 * reconfigure cannot leave a stale frequency behind.
 *
 * WHICH MEANS 0 IS REACHABLE FOR A PLL A SUCCESSFUL CALL JUST CONFIGURED
 *   Reading a PLL back needs its input select to be readable, and on some silicon that
 *   is only true once the system clock has been switched onto the PLL. So between a SUCCESSFUL
 *   nora_clock_pll_configure(PLL_1, ...) and the nora_clock_switch_source(PLL_1, ...)
 *   that follows it, such a backend answers 0 for PLL_1 while a backend that can read
 *   the select answers the frequency.  This is a window in the success path, not a
 *   failure: 0 is "this HAL cannot presently derive it", never "the call did not work".
 *
 *   A consumer that needs the number in that window takes it from
 *   nora_clock_pll_configure()'s resolved_hz output, which is what the request resolved
 *   to and is available on every backend.  A backend must NOT close the window by
 *   remembering the request and reporting it here: that would make this function
 *   sometimes a readback and sometimes a record of intent, with no way for a caller to
 *   tell which one it got -- and the intent is the value that stays confidently wrong
 *   when the hardware moves.
