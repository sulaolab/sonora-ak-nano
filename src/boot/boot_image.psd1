# boot_image.psd1 -- what the legacy resident boot image is built from. ONE authority,
# read by its command-line build and generated IDE debug project.
#
# WHY A DATA FILE AND NOT JUST THE BUILD SCRIPT
#
# Before this file the lists below lived in the build script, and the MPLAB X
# project did not exist. Adding a project by hand would have created a second
# list of 20 sources and 8 include directories, maintained by memory, in a file
# MPLAB X rewrites on its own whenever the IDE touches it. The two would have
# diverged, and the divergence would not have looked like a failure: both images
# link, both run, and the one you debugged is not quite the one you ship.
#
# So the IDE project is GENERATED from this file and a gate regenerates it into a
# temporary directory and fails on any difference. Edit this file, not generated
# project metadata. If MPLAB X rewrites that metadata, regenerate the project.
#
# WHY THIS FILE LIVES IN src/boot/ AND NOT buildtools/
#
# It is a statement about the image, not about the tooling -- the same reason the
# sources it names are in src/boot/. A reader who opens src/boot/ sees what the image is
# made of without being told which script to read first. Both consumers are in
# buildtools/ and both find it by relative path.
#
# THE SIZE CAP IS THE REASON ANY OF THIS IS CAREFUL (32 KiB on the MPS512, 16 KiB on
# the MC106 -- see Devices below for why they differ). The image is pinned at
# fixed addresses below the application; it cannot grow into it, and it cannot be
# allowed to move because something in src/app/ moved. See SizeCapBytes below and
# buildtools/verify_resident_image.ps1, which asserts the linked result.
# =====================================================================
@{
    # The MPLAB X project directory, without the .X. Named here rather than in the
    # generator because two other places need to KNOW it without generating anything:
    # buildtools/sonora_build_state.ps1 has to pick the application project out of a
    # repository that now holds two, and check_resident_project.ps1 has to find the
    # project it checks.
    #
    # ONE project with one configuration PER DEVICE -- not one project per device. A
    # second .X directory would have made Resolve-SonoraProjectDir ambiguous (it finds
    # the application project by excluding this one by name) and would have put a
    # second copy of the same 20 itemPaths in the tree. The application project
    # already expresses "same sources, several devices" as several configurations;
    # this one matches it, so the dropdown gesture is the same in both.
    ProjectName = 'resident_bootloader'

    # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # PER DEVICE -- and nothing that is not per device.
    #
    # Everything else in this file is a statement about the IMAGE and is shared: the
    # 20 sources, the 8 include directories, the macros, the compiler flags and the
    # linker options are the same on every part. What differs is which part it is,
    # what the configuration is called, which device linker script the link uses,
    # where in Flash the image goes and how large it may get.
    #
    # Splitting this into one manifest per device would have duplicated the source
    # list, and one of the two copies would have rotted -- exactly the failure this
    # file exists to prevent (see the header). Two devices, one list.
    #
    # ConfigurationName is also the build/ and dist/ subdirectory name, so each
    # device's image lands in its own place, and the command-line build and an IDE
    # build of the same configuration cannot produce two images that differ while
    # both claiming to be "the bootloader".
    #
    # LinkerScript is the APPLICATION's serial-update script for that device, reused:
    # it is the file that knows where the boot region ends and the application
    # begins, and having one script define that boundary for both images is what
    # stops the two from disagreeing. Defsym narrows it to the boot region.
    #
    # Defsym IS PER DEVICE, AND THE TWO NO LONGER AGREE. It was written out for both
    # while the values coincided, on the argument that the low 32 KiB of the panel was
    # each device's own arrangement rather than a family constant -- and on 2026-08-15
    # that turned out to be literal: the MC106's application needed one more erase page
    # than 32 KiB left it, so its boot region became 28 KiB, and on 2026-08-20 the ROM
    # diet took it to 16 KiB. Had the pair been hoisted into the shared section as "the
    # same", each of those would have been a change to both parts.
    # 0x800004 rather than 0x800000 because the reset vector at 0x800000 is not part of
    # the region the script places code into; each LENGTH is its cap minus that 4.
    #
    # SizeCapBytes is the hard cap, asserted on the LINKED image by
    # buildtools/verify_resident_image.ps1 -- not merely documented here. The
    # application's own linker script starts where this ends, so an image that
    # exceeded the cap would not fail to link, it would overlap the application.
    #
    # DfpPack is which Microchip device family pack supports the part. The two parts
    # are in DIFFERENT packs -- MP for the MPS512, MC for the MC106 -- which the build
    # script hard-coded to MP while only one device existed. That would not have failed
    # to build: it would have compiled the AK128 image against a pack that does not
    # contain p33AK128MC106.h, which is a header error at best and the wrong device
    # header at worst. The build script resolves THIS pack and asserts the part's own
    # header is in it.
    #
    # DfpPackVersion pins WHICH version of that pack. It is a floor, not a ceiling:
    # raise it when a newer pack is verified to build the image, and say what was
    # verified. Both pins were raised on 2026-08-29 (see below); the reason they had
    # to be held back until then is worth keeping, because the same shape will recur:
    #
    #   MC 1.5.263 and later removed PLL1CON.OE / PLL2CON.OE, which
    #     src/boot/hal_clock/nora_clock_dspic33ak_reg.c used to write
    #     ("has no member named 'OE'"). That write is gone now: PLLxCON has no OE
    #     bit in the data sheet either -- the DFP had copied the CLKGEN CON template
    #     -- so removing it was a correction, not an accommodation.
    #   MP 1.4.260 renamed the NOBTSWP values ON/OFF to BTSWP_ENABLED/BTSWP_DISABLED,
    #     so the #pragma config in src/boot/resident_de_boot_main.c and src/app/main.c
    #     was rejected ("unknown value"). Both now spell BTSWP_DISABLED; the fuse bit
    #     is unchanged.
    #
    # Both failures read as defects in this repository and were not, and both appeared
    # only in a fresh clone -- a clone with an existing dist/ never rebuilds the boot
    # image and so never saw them. Pinning here rather than in the build script
    # keeps it with the other per-device facts, and next to the reason.

    # here, because the one instance of the trapping shape (a base register
    # holding a pointer DIFFERENCE rather than an address) was in the -O2 build's
    # nora_nvm_verify, and -Os bases that load on the real Flash address. The asm
    # guard stays single-register under -Os. Full analysis, including why
