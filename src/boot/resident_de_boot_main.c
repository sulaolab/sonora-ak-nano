/* mikroBUS I2C pad selection -- and why fuses live HERE, in an image that never
 * touches I2C.
 *
 * A #pragma config is not code and is not "run" by whoever declares it: it tells
 * the linker to emit a word at a fixed flash address (FDEVOPT = 0x7F3020), which
 * the device reads AT RESET and latches for the whole run.  So these settings
 * govern the APPLICATION's pin mapping, for as long as it runs, even though the
 * bootloader itself only ever speaks UART.
 *
 * Ownership follows the address, not the user.  The application is linked into
 * its own region above this one (AK128 0x804000.., AK512 0x808000..) and delivered
 * by serial update, and a serial update writes ONLY that region -- it cannot
 * rewrite a fuse at all.  The resident bootloader is what the programmer writes,
 * so it is the only image that can guarantee a fuse.  Consequence worth stating
 * plainly: any fuse the APPLICATION depends on must be declared here.
 * src/app/main.c declares the same settings, but on a serial-update image those
 * declarations cannot take effect; treat this file as the authority and keep the
 * two in step.
 *
 * That asymmetry is exactly what the first AK128 bi-codec hardware run found
 * (2026-08-17): ALTI2C2 was here, so codec A answered on I2C2; ALTI2C1 was only
 * in main.c, so I2C1 stayed on its standard pads and codec B's device-ID read
 * failed.
 *
 * ALTI2C2 is unconditional -- both parts put codec A's mikroBUS-A SDA/SCL on the
 * I2C2 alternate pads. */

 * agree on how mikroBUS-B is wired.
 *
 *   AK128  mikroBUS-B SDA/SCL = DIM-P4/P6 = ASDA1/ASCL1  -> needs ALTI2C1 = ON
 *   AK512  mikroBUS-B is on I2C3, standard pads          -> ALTI2C3 stays OFF

 *
 * So AK512 never enables I2C1 and gains nothing here, while its fuse word is
 * part of a working, shipped image -- leave it alone.
 *
 * On AK128 this is safe for every image, not only the bi-codec one: I2C1's
 * STANDARD pads are RB3 (DIM-P13) and RB4 (DIM-P43 = S2 push button), so
