The sound is FIXED (analysis doc section 44: the design was frozen in section 38,
then four board rounds -- 40..43 -- corrected the level and two artefacts, and
section 44.1 tabulates every value that is now locked). This tool is the wav -> py
-> table link for it, the same chain `gen_dsp_tick_tables.py` restored for the
tick samples: the header is generated, never hand-edited, and the npz stays the
authoritative source.

What ends up in the header
--------------------------
  wave      one engine cycle per RPM bin, band-limited and decimated to the
            per-bin point count, int16 on a power-of-two scale
  noise     the shared pre-shaped residual-noise table (section 20's structure),
            4 engine cycles x 512 points
  noise_env the cycle-angular envelope of the residual noise -- **one shared
            curve**, not one per bin. Measured: per-bin curves stray 1.76 dB
            (mean |dev|) from the shared one and 1.83 dB from flat, so the
            per-bin set buys 0.07 dB for 6.4 kB. Flat is not used either: the
            shared curve keeps the cycle-locked noise modulation, which is part
            of what the owner hears as the cam clatter.
  win       the overlap-add window, as the rising half only -- see below
  rpm/gain/noise_rms   per-bin metadata, float32
  noise_norm  the constant that replaces the prototype's per-block std()

Point count per bin is a **schedule**, not one number
-----------------------------------------------------
Section 21 measured 256 points per cycle as free (0.19 dB) -- but it measured it
on an *acceleration* clip (2477-6301 rpm). A table of P points per cycle is
band-limited to crank order P/4, and that is a fixed *order*, so the Hz it
reaches scales with RPM:

    P = 256  ->  order  64  ->  7.3 kHz at 6875 rpm, but only 960 Hz at 900 rpm

The cam clatter the owner judges lives at 1.5-8 kHz, so at the settled 900 rpm
idle a 256-point table would throw all of it away, and section 21's number does
not cover that case. So the point count is per bin here, and `a34_impl_check.py`
measures section 32's imp/fold at the idle for each schedule below. Do not change
the default without re-running it.

# strongest at ~4300 rpm, exactly the 4125/4375 pair. Replacing every bin's phase
# spectrum with one measured bin's leaves each bin's MAGNITUDE spectrum untouched
# (so no bin changes timbre in isolation) and takes every pair to 0.00 dB. The
