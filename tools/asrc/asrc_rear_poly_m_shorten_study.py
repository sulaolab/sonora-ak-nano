"""Host-only study: shortening the GENERIC REAR polyphase (M taps, L=128 phases).

Why this stage.  The 2026-09-06 F1 dissection of asrc_pull measured every bucket
inside the 69.1 us `pullBA`, and two of them scale with the rear tap count M:

    mac  40.1 us  58 %   mchp_asrc_q31_row16, 12ch x M-tap Q31 dot per output frame
    bl   22.5 us  33 %   mchp_asrc_q31_blend_row, ONE M-tap row interpolation per frame

Everything else (conv 3.4 / ph 1.7 / st 0.7 / rest 0.7) is fixed.  So M is worth
~1.62 us per tap on a leg A callback -- roughly FOUR TIMES the pre-stage's 0.45 us
per non-zero tap, because the rear runs at the 96 kHz output rate across 12 channels
AND pays a per-frame row blend on top. The pre-stage lever topped out at +8.68 us/A
in total; ONE rear tap is +1.62.

The three bit-exact candidates of the F1 report are already spent -- they are the
`*au` bits -- and the blended-row memo is dead (hit = 0).  With approximation
permitted (owner ruling 2026-09-08 #1) the tap count is the remaining lever here.

WHICH GATE JUDGES THIS, and why it is NOT the one that judged the pre-stage.
=========================================================================
The composed 96 -> 32 kHz gate (asrc_96_to_32_audio_gate.py, and its two-fold
wrapper composed_96_32() in asrc_fir_lightweight_feasibility.py) was written to judge
the PRE-STAGE and the RATIONAL stage with the rear held fixed -- its own banner says
"rear end : ... (UNCHANGED)".  Structurally it applies the rear's magnitude to the
alias term at the FOLDED LANDING frequency (`mag_at(rear, ..., land)`, gate line 182),
which is inside the rear's passband, so the rear contributes ~0 dB to every alias
number that model produces.

    Consequence, measured: sweeping M from 30 down to 18 moves composed alias13 by
    0.2 dB (-100.5 -> -100.7).  That flatness is the MODEL BEING BLIND TO THIS
    FILTER, not evidence that an 18-tap rear is safe.  Do not quote composed alias
    figures as authority for a rear tap count.

What the composed model does capture for the rear is the PASSBAND: the wanted-signal
term applies the rear at `band`, so floor13 / peak13 / w14 / w15 are valid, and they
are the 32 kHz-rate-correct view of the droop.  Both are printed, labelled.

The authority for the rear's own stopband already exists and is used here unchanged:
asrc_headroom_filter_check.analyze(), the gate the shipping rear was accepted under --
worst image over the first image band and the passband edge, with the shipped
thresholds max_image_db = -105.0 and max_edge_loss_db = -1.1 carried on the Candidate
itself.  Its normalisation (AUDIO_EDGE = 20 kHz of 48 kHz) is that gate's own
convention and is left alone; the rear's shape is rate-agnostic in normalised terms.

Unlike the pre-stage, shortening this filter moves the passband too: its cutoff is
0.465 of 32 kHz = 14.88 kHz, so 13-15 kHz sits on the shoulder.  cutoff and Kaiser
beta are therefore re-chosen for every M -- the pre-stage study's lesson (a window
parameter picked for the long filter is badly mistuned once it gets short) applies
verbatim.
