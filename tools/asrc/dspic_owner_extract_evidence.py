"""Evidence extractor for the dsPIC-owner 2026-07-31 run.

Reads a serial capture (a file on disk -- never the COM port) and emits the
compact artifacts the measurement commit needs: the fill histogram that backs
section 10.6, representative telemetry lines, and SHA-256 of every raw log so
the bulk captures can stay out of Git.

Both paths are ARGUMENTS, not constants.  The capture and the evidence directory
live outside this working tree -- the bulk logs are not committed -- so a
hardcoded path to either goes stale the moment a tree is reorganised, and this
script carried exactly that: a capture path under a tools directory that has
since moved to a repository of its own.
