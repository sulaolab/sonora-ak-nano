# den == 3 -- the 48 -> 16 kHz decimator.  REPURPOSED 2026-07-29.
#
# It used to be the two-stage front end for the 11.025 kHz path (69 taps at 48 kHz to reach
# 16 kHz, then a 75-tap decimate-by-1 stage at 16 kHz to pull the band down to the 5512.5 Hz
# output Nyquist).  The /4 respec moved 11.025 kHz to den == 4, which left den == 3 selected by
# no rate at all -- 6286 bytes of flash and a boot selftest chain for code the audio path could
# never reach.  den == 3 now serves a **16 kHz output**, which is what the name always implied.
#
# SINGLE STAGE, and that is forced, not a simplification.  A 3:1 decimation to 16 kHz folds
# everything at multiples of 16 kHz, and the output Nyquist IS 8000 Hz -- the intermediate's own
# Nyquist -- so every input above 8000 Hz lands somewhere inside the final band during the
# decimation itself.  No stage placed after it can help: once two frequencies share an output
# bin they cannot be separated.  Measured control (report section 12.1): relaxing stage 1 and
# adding a 75-tap "repair" stage at 16 kHz moves the worst alias from -14.8 dB only to
# -21.2 dB.  So the single stage carries the whole anti-alias job with its stopband pinned on
# 8000 Hz, and it needs to be long: 161 taps against the /4 chain's 27-tap first stage, because
# a den == 4 or 6 first stage gets a huge transition band for free (it only has to suppress what
# would fold into the FINAL band after the remaining halvings) while den == 2 and 3 have no
# remaining rate change and pay the full transition.
#
# Passband 5900 Hz (0.74 of the 8000 Hz Nyquist) was chosen from this trade -- taps against DSP
# budget, all RAM-neutral (the union ceiling is 190 taps' worth of history):
#   5600 Hz -> 137 taps -> 45.7 units -> ~37 us -> predicted margin ~35 us (12 kHz class)
#   5900 Hz -> 161 taps -> 53.7 units -> ~44 us -> predicted margin ~29 us   <- chosen
#   6100 Hz -> 173 taps -> 57.7 units -> ~47 us -> predicted margin ~25 us (thinnest)
#   6300 Hz -> 193 taps -> RAM grows past the union ceiling
# Cascade alias -116.1 dB out of band, passband edge -0.01 dB (gate -100 dB).
#
# 161 taps rather than the 157 that the transition width alone would suggest.  At 157 the stage's
# OWN stopband is only -92.3 dB: a Kaiser beta=11 design reaches its -108 dB asymptote only once
# the tap count covers the transition, and 5900 -> 8000 Hz at 48 kHz needs about 159.  The
# cascade at 157 taps still measured -108.3 dB, because the resampler's fc = 0.465*16000 =
# 7440 Hz happens to cover exactly the stage's weak spot just above 8000 Hz (content at 8100 Hz
# folds to 7900 Hz, where the resampler is already rolling off).  That is a real and stable
# effect -- but the whole point of a single-stage front end here is that nothing downstream can
# be relied on, so leaning on it to clear the gate would contradict the structure.  161 taps
# costs 1.1 us and takes the stage alone to -107.5 dB and the cascade to -116.1 dB, which is
# cheaper than giving up passband (157 taps needs 5850 Hz to clear the same bar).
#
# The resampler's contribution is therefore a margin bonus, not a dependency: stage alone
# -107.5 dB, cascade -116.1 dB.
#
# The per-rate survey established that an alias cannot be repaired downstream of
# the fold that created it.

#   front end 49.1 us vs the /3 chain's measured 51.5 us   (-2.4 us)
#   pull      113.2 us vs 116.9 us, since step falls 1.45125 -> 1.08843  (-3.7 us)

#              2026-07-29 -- see the note above QUARTER12K below; the choice stands)
# The 12 kHz intermediate does NOT let the resampler absorb the anti-alias job --
# with stage 2 removed the cascade measures -0.2 dB, i.e. the resampler contributes
# essentially NOTHING. The reason is where aliases arrive: the worst ones land at
# multiples of the intermediate rate (12.1 kHz folds to 100 Hz), and at those fold
# centres the resampler sees a LOW frequency and passes it at full level. Its
# fc = 0.465*12000 = 5580 Hz never gets to act on them. So stage 2 is
# still mandatory, and because its input rate doubles (16 -> 24 kHz) its relative
# transition halves and it needs MORE taps than the /3 chain's stage 2, not fewer.
# All of the saving comes from stage 1: 27 taps at 24 kHz replaces 69 at 16 kHz.
#
# Stage 1's stopband edge is 24000 - 5512.5 = 18487.5 Hz: it only has to suppress

#
# Measured cascade (tools/asrc/asrc_lowpass_rate_survey.py, gate limit -100 dB).  These are the
# CORRECTED figures -- the gate's alias mask was wrong until 2026-07-29 and had been reporting
# these rows 7-25 dB optimistic; see the mask note in worst_alias() there.  The passband choice

# den == 2 -- the 48 -> 24 kHz decimator, for a 24 kHz OUTPUT (2026-07-29).
#
# SINGLE STAGE, forced by the same structure that forces it for den == 3: a 2:1 decimation to
# 24 kHz folds at multiples of 24 kHz and the 24 kHz output's Nyquist IS the intermediate's
# (12000 Hz), so every input above 12000 Hz lands inside the final band during the decimation
# itself.  Nothing placed after it can separate frequencies already summed into one bin (report
# section 12).  So the stopband is pinned ON 12000 Hz and this filter carries the whole job.
#
# HALF-BAND SPECIALISATION WAS PRICED AND REJECTED.  The obvious saving for a 2:1 stage is a
# half-band filter (transition centred on fs/4, every other tap zero, ~half the multiplies), but
# that requires the stopband to start ABOVE the output Nyquist and leans on the resampler to
# cover the gap.  Measured: every candidate from +-300 Hz to +-1800 Hz around 12000 Hz needs
# more than 401 taps, because the resampler's 30-tap prototype has far too gentle a transition
# to cover a half-band transition band.  The saving is negative, so the stopband stays pinned.
#
# 107 taps is the smallest ODD count that clears -100 dB with the stage evaluated ALONE, which
# is the bar the 16 kHz /3 stage was held to and for the same reason -- a single-stage front end
# must not depend on downstream help.  The cascade figure is a bonus, not the gate:
#   103 taps -> stage alone  -85.81 dB, cascade -101.71 dB   (cascade passes, stage does not)
#   105 taps -> stage alone  -92.41 dB, cascade -108.32 dB   (same)
#   107 taps -> stage alone -102.37 dB, cascade -115.91 dB   <- chosen, 53.5 units
#   109 taps -> stage alone -109.14 dB, cascade -116.06 dB
# Passband edge loss -0.010 dB.  RAM cost is zero: the union that holds every front end is sized
# by the /6 member (190 taps' worth of history), and 107 is far below that ceiling.
#
# Passband 8850 Hz = 0.7375 of the 12000 Hz Nyquist -- the SAME relative width the 16 kHz stage
# carries (5900 / 8000).  Two independent cross-checks that this is the consistent choice rather
# than a coincidence: the relative passband matches, and scaling the 16 kHz stage's tap count by
# the transition-width ratio gives 161 * (2100 / 3150) = 107.3.
#
# If the measured DSP margin turns out too thin, the ONLY remaining lever is a narrower
# passband (half-band is closed, above).  Priced under the same two bars:
#   8400 Hz ->  95 taps -> 47.5 units  (-6.0 units, stage alone -108.66 dB)
#   8000 Hz ->  85 taps -> 42.5 units  (-11.0 units, stage alone -106.71 dB)
# The same target measurements establish the selected tradeoff.

# Second /2 coefficient set, for a 22.05 kHz OUTPUT (2026-07-29).  Same relationship to the
# 24 kHz set above as QUARTER12K_ has to QUARTER_: two coefficient sets over ONE structure,
# sharing the tap count -- and therefore the union member, the mirrored-history layout and the
# tap-loop literals.  Selecting one costs a coefficient pointer, not a second ISR code path.
#
# 22.05 kHz is NOT 48000/2, so the structure differs from the 24 kHz case in an important way:
# the stage still decimates 48 -> 24 kHz (den == 2 is the only integer choice whose intermediate
# rate is >= 22.05 kHz), and the RESAMPLER then pulls 24000 -> 22050 at step 1.0884.  So the
# intermediate Nyquist is 12000 Hz but the OUTPUT Nyquist is 11025 Hz, 975 Hz lower.
#
# REUSING THE 24 kHz SET WAS PRICED FIRST AND FAILS BADLY.  It is the obvious move -- same
# structure, same taps, zero new coefficients -- but the 24 kHz filter is only 18.91 dB down at
# 11025 Hz, so input between 11025 and 12000 Hz walks through the stage and then folds into the
# 22.05 kHz band in the resampler.  Measured with the stopband left at 12000 Hz:
#   cascade -24.70 dB, stage alone -19.74 dB  (limit -100 dB) -- FAIL by ~80 dB.
# Hence the stopband is re-pinned ON the OUTPUT Nyquist, 11025 Hz.
#
# The resampler contributes almost nothing here (-24.70 cascade vs -19.74 alone is ~5 dB), so
# this set is held to the STAGE-ALONE -100 dB bar, exactly like the 24 kHz and 16 kHz stages.
# Tap search at that bar (units = taps * 24000/48000, i.e. taps * 0.5):
#   passband 6800 Hz ->  81 taps -> 40.5 units, stage alone -109.02 dB
#   passband 7500 Hz ->  97 taps -> 48.5 units, stage alone -109.08 dB
#   passband 7875 Hz -> 107 taps -> 53.5 units, stage alone -102.22 dB   <- chosen
#   passband 8000 Hz -> 113 taps -> 56.5 units, stage alone -108.84 dB
#   passband 8200 Hz -> 119 taps -> 59.5 units, stage alone -100.97 dB
# 7875 Hz = 11025 - 3150, i.e. the SAME 3150 Hz transition width the 24 kHz set carries -- which
# is why the tap count comes out identical at 107 (taps follow transition width in Hz at a fixed
# input rate).  That identity is the whole reason the variant is free: shared tap count means
# shared structure, so RAM and flash both stay put.
#
# Margin risk, stated up front: the stage costs the same 53.5 units as the 24 kHz set AND the
# resampler runs non-unity (step 1.0884) instead of at 1.0, so 22.05 kHz may displace 24 kHz as
# the thinnest rate -- and 24 kHz already measures only 18.9-21.1 us of TDMsum margin.  If it
# does not fit, the lever is a narrower passband (7500 Hz / 97 taps, -5.0 units, priced above);
# half-band specialisation is closed for den == 2 for the reason given in the block above.

# The 96 -> 48 kHz PRE-STAGE (2026-08-02).  Sits in FRONT of every block above, and it is the
# first filter in this file whose input is not 48 kHz -- hence its own PRESTAGE_INPUT_HZ.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS.  Against a 96 kHz leg A, the look-ahead one ASRC pull needs,
#   R(step) = floor(step * (APP_BLOCK_FRAMES - 1)) + ASRC_POLY_AHEAD + 1
# is proportional to the rate ratio, while the ring offers at most ASRC_FILL_TARGET_MAX = 104
# frames (FIFO 128, BLOCK 16).  96 k -> 16 k needs 110 and 96 k -> 8 k needs 200, so the setpoint
# CLAMPS: the tail outputs of each block fail the window test, emit zeros and hold rd -- audible
# break-up.  A /2 in front halves the step the ASRC sees, taking R+jitter to 35..36.  (Halving
# APP_BLOCK_FRAMES instead was measured and rejected: duty 62.3 -> 82.2 %, margin down to 14.8 us,
# and 11.025 kHz still broken.)
#
# 21 TAPS, NOT 107, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE WHOLE POINT.  Scaling the proven 48 -> 24 kHz /2
# stage to a 96 kHz input (passband 0.7375 of Nyquist -> 17700 Hz) also gives 107 taps, but its
# output is 48 kHz rather than 24 kHz, so under the units = taps * (output_rate / 48000) cost model
# each tap costs TWICE as much: 107 units ~ 87.7 us of a 166.6 us window, which prices the feature
# out at every rate and nearly produced a false no-go (study section 6.1).
#
# That 107-tap figure is the price of a /2 that must stand ALONE -- correct only where the stage's
# output IS the final rate.  Here it is the FIRST OF TWO stages, exactly like the /6 chain's 27-tap
# first stage, whose own header states the principle: it is short because "a later rate change is
# still pending, so it only has to suppress what would fold into the FINAL band after that
# change."  So the passband only has to protect the final band, and the stopband only has to start
# where energy would fold into it after the remaining decimation, at 48000 - final_Nyquist.  That
# is an enormous transition width, and 21 taps clear the same stage-alone -100 dB bar (17.2 us).
#
# ONE SHARED SET COVERS THE WHOLE MENU -- no variant enum, no coefficient pointer, no `fe=` tag,
# which is a genuine simplification over the /4 and /2 stages it sits in front of.  Designed
# against the TIGHTEST case: passband 15000 Hz (the 48 -> 32 kHz `:audio` stage's own passband
# edge, and the widest second-stage passband in the menu) and stopband from 48000 - 16000 =
# 32000 Hz (32 kHz's fold edge, the lowest).  Measured stage-alone at each rate's own stopband
# edge, with the resulting passband-edge loss:
#    8000 -> edge 44000 -> -124.22 dB, pb edge -0.0001 dB
#   11025 -> edge 42488 -> -119.43 dB, pb edge -0.0001 dB
#   12000 -> edge 42000 -> -119.43 dB, pb edge -0.0001 dB
#   16000 -> edge 40000 -> -115.88 dB, pb edge -0.0001 dB
#   22050 -> edge 36975 -> -112.77 dB, pb edge -0.0001 dB
#   24000 -> edge 36000 -> -110.23 dB, pb edge -0.0001 dB
#   32000 -> edge 32000 -> -108.38 dB, pb edge -0.0001 dB   <- the binding case
#
# WIDENED 21 -> 27 TAPS ON 2026-09-02, and the reason is a gate, not a filter.  The original set
# was designed for four rates only (passband 6400 / stopband 40000) because 22.05 and 24 kHz were
# deliberately left on the direct path: their R+jitter of 85 and 80 fitted the cap of 104, so a
# front end bought them nothing.  ASRC_FILL_SLACK_REQUIRED (added 2026-08-24 from a 100-pair
# hardware sweep) changed that criterion: the servo needs 8 frames of slack ABOVE R, and at
# step 4.3537 (96/22.05) the setpoint clamps to R + ASRC_FILL_JITTER = 4, so
# audio_app_asrc_rate_pair_is_supported() now REFUSES 96 k -> 22.05 kHz.  24 kHz survives only
# because its step is exactly 4 and floor == ceil earns the exact-step exemption.  Giving 22.05 kHz
# a composed /4 puts the resampler back at step 1.0884 (R 32, set 64, slack 32) and the pair is
# accepted.  The old 21-tap set could NOT be reused for it: at the 36975 Hz fold edge it reads only
# -58.09 dB (and -50.42 dB at 24 kHz's 36000 Hz), i.e. adding the row with the old coefficients
# would have traded a refused pair for an aliased one.
#
# The set is designed to cover 24 kHz as well even though the routing gate does not yet publish a
# den for it (that rate still resamples directly and is unprotected -- a separate decision).  The
# cost of covering it is 2 taps, and it means enabling that row later needs no filter work at all.
# Full-cascade check over each chain's own designed passband: ripple 0.0001 dB, min -0.0001 dB,
# i.e. the pre-stage is transparent in band and adds no droop.  It does NOT share the history
# union with the stages behind it, because a composed chain runs both at once.
#
# WIDENED AGAIN 27 -> 41 TAPS ON 2026-09-03, to admit the 96 -> 32 kHz row.  Same shape of reason
# as the 21 -> 27 step: a new final rate moves the TIGHTEST case, and the old set does not merely
# lose margin at it, it fails outright.  32 kHz is now the lowest fold edge in the menu
# (48000 - 16000 = 32000 Hz, below 24 kHz's 36000) and its second stage -- the L=2/M=3 `:audio`
# polyphase -- needs the pre-stage flat to 15000 Hz, the widest passband in the menu.  Swept at
# that pair, the 27-tap set reads only -47.95 dB at the 32000 Hz fold edge: composing it would
# have shipped an audible alias, not a thin margin.  41 taps is the minimum that clears the same
# stage-alone -100 dB bar used everywhere in this file, at -108.38 dB.
#
# WHY THIS IS STILL ONE SHARED SET AND NOT A FOURTH VARIANT.  Widening to the 32 kHz case raises
# the margin of ALL SIX existing rows -- uniformly -107.46 dB before, -110.23 .. -124.22 dB after
# (table above) -- because every one of them has a fold edge above 32000 Hz and a passband below
# 15000 Hz, so the new design dominates the old one pointwise.  A variant would buy nothing and
# cost a selector.  The two WIDE variants below are different: their stopbands (25950 / 24000 Hz)
# sit BELOW 32000, so no shared set can reach them.
#
# COST OF THE WIDENING.  14 more taps: RAM +112 B/ch of mirrored history (DEC_Q31_PRE_RING 41 ->
# 55, so DEC_Q31_HIST_PER_CH 250 -> 264, ~ +448 B at 8 channels), and 14 more MACs per pre-stage
# output.  Under the units = taps * (output_rate / 48000) model the pre-stage costs 41 units, i.e.
# it is still a fraction of the 107 units a stand-alone /2 would need, which is the whole reason
# the composed topology exists (see the 21 TAPS, NOT 107 paragraph above).
#
# DO NOT re-litigate the -99.78 dB reading at the 12 kHz cascade's 6000 Hz band edge: it is a
# sampling artifact, not a defect.  It sits exactly ON the existing /4 chain's own stopband edge,
# reads -100.70 dB one Hz above and -108.35 dB fifty Hz above, and does not move with pre-stage tap
# count (21/23/25 all give -99.78 dB) -- the tell that the pre-stage is not its source.  The
# shipping gate evaluates an alias MASK, not bare |H| at the band edge.  From a 96 kHz source the
# /4 chain alone would pass 12 kHz aliases at 0.00 dB, so the correct verdict is a ~100 dB

# TWO WIDE PRE-STAGE VARIANTS, for the only two 96 kHz rows the shared set above cannot serve
# (2026-09-03).  Everything the shared set covers keeps using it; these do not replace it.
#
# WHY A VARIANT AND NOT A WIDER SHARED SET.  The pre-stage must remove whatever would fold into
# the FINAL band, so its stopband edge is 48000 - final_Nyquist and its passband has to reach the
# final band edge.  For a 48 kHz final rate that is a 20000 -> 24000 Hz transition at a 96 kHz
# input -- 4.3x narrower than the shared set's 15000 -> 32000 Hz -- so the tap count goes
# 41 -> 169 (the shared set reads only -7.48 dB at that fold edge, and -15.54 dB at the
# 44.1 kHz one).  Running 169 taps on the rows that need 41 would cost every composed chain 4x the
# MACs for attenuation none of them uses: stage-alone, the 169-tap set reads -111.39 dB at the
# 44.1 kHz fold edge where 113 taps already give -100.68 dB, and the shared set reads -110.23 dB
# at 24 kHz.  Hence three sets, selected by the FINAL rate.
#
# TAP COUNTS ARE MINIMA, swept against the same -100 dB stage-alone bar as the sets above:
# 111 taps reads -91.92 dB and 167 taps -98.72 dB, so neither is "nearly enough".  Passband
# ripple is 0.0001 dB and |H| at the 20 kHz band edge -0.0000 dB for both, i.e. these buy their
# stopband without giving up the top of the audio band.
#
# NOT COMPOSED WITH ANYTHING.  Both variants serve a chain whose second stage is empty (96 ->
# 48 kHz, and then the resampler pulls 48 -> 44.1 kHz or runs at step 1.0).  That is what lets
# the Q31 front end hand them the whole history arena instead of the pre-stage reserve -- see
# DEC_Q31_PRE_RING_WIDE in asrc_decimator_q31.inc.  A composed chain always takes the 27-tap set,
# so no chain in the file ever needs a wide ring AND a second stage's rings at the same time.

# A HALF-BAND replacement for the SHARED pre-stage, generated into its own include so that a
# build which does not ask for it does not carry floats it never reads.  Measurement-only
# when it landed (2026-09-06); production-permitted since 2026-09-08.
#
# It is the same windowed-sinc design as every other set here, with the cutoff pinned to
# fs/4 = 24000 Hz -- (pass + stop) / 2 in design(), so pass 16000 / stop 32000.  That is what
# makes it half-band: sinc(offset/2) is exactly zero at every EVEN offset from the centre, so
# with taps = 4*half - 1 the centre M = 2*half - 1 is ODD and the surviving taps are the even
# ABSOLUTE indices plus M -- 17 of 31 here.  The kernel skips the other 14 because the FILTER
# STRUCTURE makes them zero, which is the only arithmetic this study is allowed to drop; no
# channel and no slot is skipped anywhere.
#
# The stopband requirement it has to clear is the SHARED set's, 32000 Hz (48000 - 16000, a
# 32 kHz output's fold edge).  Its passband edge lands at 16000 Hz rather than the shared
# set's 15000 Hz -- the half-band mirror gives that away for free, and 16000 is wider than
# the 15000 the composed chain needs.
#
# 35 -> 31 TAPS on 2026-09-08, with beta 11 -> 10.  This is a CPU decision taken against a
# measured wall: the 96 kHz leg runs 3x inside one 500 us 32 kHz leg window, so the two MACs
# per output that 31 taps saves are worth 3x that on the leg deadline that actually binds
# (+2.74 us, taking the measured TDM2 margin from +1.3 us to +4.0 us).  It costs 6.9 dB of
# protected-band alias floor, -107.4 -> -100.5 dBc, which is inside the documented gate's
# "acceptable" class and nothing further was permitted: 27 taps reads -90.5 dBc and 23 taps
# -76.4 dBc, both rejected by the owner on 2026-09-08.
#
# BETA MUST TRAVEL WITH THE TAP COUNT.  At this length the module default 11.0 reads
# -96.4 dBc, which FAILS the gate; 10.0 reads -100.5 dBc and passes.  The two constants are
# one decision -- do not change either alone. Curves for every length and beta are
# reproducible with
# tools/asrc/asrc_96_to_32_prestage_shorten_study.py.
#
# The passband is untouched by the shortening (0..13 kHz floor stays -0.44 dB, 15 kHz stays
# -10.1 dB) -- that 15 kHz droop belongs to the N97 rear stage, not to this filter, and is
# tracked separately.

# 48 kHz -> 32 kHz "Audio mode": the L=2/M=3 rational polyphase front end.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT.  It is not a strict 48->32 front end and must not be described as one: it
# does NOT protect the whole 0-16 kHz output band.  The prototype's transition band runs from
# 15 kHz to the 16 kHz output Nyquist, which leaves residual aliasing in 13-16 kHz (worst
# -25.5 dB) while 0-13 kHz is protected below about -105 dB. N = 97 is fixed by the
# study's option B and is not a knob to be turned here.
#
# STRUCTURE.  48/32 = 3/2 has no integer decimation, so the chain is conceptually
# "up L=2 / lowpass at the 96 kHz interpolated rate / down M=3".  The prototype therefore lives
# at 96 kHz, not at 48 kHz, and is decomposed into the L=2 phase rows so that the firmware never
# zero-stuffs and never computes a tap against a known-zero sample:
#
#     y[2q]   = sum_i h[2i]   * x[3q   - i]      i = 0 .. 48   (49 taps, ends at input 3q)
#     y[2q+1] = sum_i h[2i+1] * x[3q+1 - i]      i = 0 .. 47   (48 taps, ends at input 3q+1)
#
# Both rows read CONSECUTIVE input samples and both hop by M=3 input samples between successive
# outputs of the same row, which is exactly the (taps, decim) shape the existing Q31 block kernel
# already serves -- see asrc_decimator_q31.inc.
#
# GAIN.  design() normalises the prototype to unit sum, but a zero-stuffed input only ever
# presents half of the taps with a non-zero sample, so each phase row would carry a gain of 1/L.
# The rows are therefore scaled by L, which makes each row sum to ~1 and the chain unity-gain at
# DC.  Scaling by an exact power of two is exact in float32, so the emitted rows are bit-exactly
# 2 x the prototype taps.
