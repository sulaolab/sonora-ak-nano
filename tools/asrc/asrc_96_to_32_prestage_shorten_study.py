"""Host-only study: how short can the 96->48 kHz half-band pre-stage get, and what
does each step actually BUY on leg A?

Why this exists.  The E family of asrc_fir_lightweight_feasibility.py answered a
DIFFERENT question -- "which half-band holds the shipping composed 96->32 numbers
exactly" -- and its answer was 35 taps (19 non-zero).  Its search lattice therefore
started at 27 taps and its accept test was "no worse than the 41-tap dense
pre-stage".  With approximation now permitted (owner ruling 2026-09-08 #1), the
question becomes what the quality/CPU curve looks like BELOW that point, so the
lattice is extended down to 11 taps and nothing is rejected: every point is reported
with its degradation, and the human picks.

QUALITY.  Not re-modelled here.  composed_96_32() and halfband() are imported from
asrc_fir_lightweight_feasibility.py, which in turn drives asrc_96_to_32_audio_gate.py
two folds deep with the unchanged N97 prototype and the unchanged generic rear.  Using
the same model is the point: these numbers are directly comparable to every earlier
row, including the shipping reference.

CPU.  No host timing is used.  A half-band of length 4h-1 costs 2h+1 = nz MACs per
output, the block emits BLOCK_FRAMES/2 outputs per channel, and the per-MAC cost is
the MEASURED 1.012 cycles/MAC at the 200 MHz instruction rate, then scaled by the
MEASURED realisation factor of the HB35 landing (-10.05 us actual against -10.69 us
theoretical for the same 41 -> 19 nz step, = 0.94).  That factor is what keeps this a
projection from hardware rather than from arithmetic.

LEVERAGE.  leg A runs 3x inside one 500 us leg B window, so a saving of D us per A
callback opens 3D us of the leg B wall measured on target.
Both columns are printed because only the leg B one decides feasibility.
