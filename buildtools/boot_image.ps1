<#
  Shared reader for src/boot/boot_image.psd1 -- the legacy resident-image manifest.

  WHY A SEPARATE FILE

  Several maintenance consumers need the manifest in slightly different forms:
  one builds a device image, one generates an IDE debug project, one checks that
  generated project, and the shared build state needs the set of devices with an image.

  The manifest is shared-plus-per-device (Devices / DefaultDevice), so every one of
  those consumers would otherwise have written its own "shared keys, then override
  with the device's" merge. Four merges is four places for a key to be forgotten --
  and a forgotten key here does not fail loudly: it silently builds the default
  device's image under another device's name. So the merge lives here, once, and it
  validates while it is at it.

  Dot-source it:  . (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'boot_image.ps1')
#>

# Every device's entry must carry all of these. They are the whole of what differs
# from part to part; anything else in the manifest is shared by construction.

                                'DfpPack', 'DfpPackVersion')

      Reads and VALIDATES src/boot/boot_image.psd1. Validation is here rather than in

      is read, naming the key -- not later, as a link error or a wrong-looking image.
