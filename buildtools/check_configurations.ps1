<#
  C0.2 -- the MPLAB project configuration gate.

  configurations.xml is the authority on what each build compiles, and MPLAB X
  rewrites it whenever the IDE touches the project. It has silently dropped
  ex="true" attributes before. An exclusion that quietly disappears does not break
  the build: it makes a standalone application link the download engine without
  saying so, which is a defect you find on a board rather than at a desk.

  So the per-configuration expectations live here, in a checked-in script that
  exits non-zero -- not in a document, and not in a throwaway audit run by hand
  when someone remembers to be suspicious.

  DELIBERATELY NOT A GENERATED BASELINE. The sibling separation ratchet uses a
  ratchet, which is right for a metric that should only ever fall. This is not
  that: the values below are design intent (three configurations, two delivery
  modes), and a regenerable baseline would happily absorb the exact MPLAB X
  regression this exists to catch. Changing an expectation is an edit to this
  table, made on purpose, and reviewable as such.

  Companion to Assert-StandaloneMapLayout in build.ps1, which checks the same
  contract on the LINKED result. This one checks the inputs, and it does so
  without building -- so it runs in seconds, on any machine, with no toolchain.

#
# WHY THIS IS AN ERROR AND NOT A WARNING. Both halves still compile and link with
# different pack versions, and the resulting hex still runs. What differs is the
# register definitions and config-pragma value names the two images were built
# against, for the same silicon, in a pair of images that are flashed together and
# share a mailbox ABI. Nothing downstream reports it.
#
# Only delivery configurations are compared. A standalone configuration ships without
# a resident boot image, so there is no second half for it to disagree with.

# the two halves name the same one. Raising a pin is a deliberate edit to
# boot_image.psd1 AND to the IDE project; both were raised to the newest installed
# pack on 2026-08-29 (MP 1.5.269, MC 1.6.272) once the two things that had held them
# back were taken up in the sources: the PLLxCON.OE writes (a bit that does not exist)
