Usage:
  pwsh ./buildtools/build.ps1 [-Full|-Clean|-Generate] [-Jobs N]
      [-FirmwareVersion N] [-NoDelivery]

Modes:
  (none)     Build the active selection.
  -Full      Generate makefiles, clean, then build.
  -Clean     Clean outputs only.
  -Generate  Generate MPLAB X makefiles only.

Selection:
  Comes from ./buildtools/switch_config.ps1 (no environment variable is
  involved), which stores three choices in buildtools/active_build.json:
  serial update support, target device and application profile. The MPLAB
  configuration is derived from the last two, not chosen.
  A build cleans first only when the profile differs from what the existing
  objects were built with (or that is unknown, e.g. after an IDE build).

Build products:
  FACTORY_IMAGE   dist/<conf>/production/*.factory.production.hex
                  The release programming artifact in both delivery modes. With
                  serial update support it is the resident bootloader + the
                  application + a committed manifest; without, it is the
                  standalone application.
  SERIAL_UPDATE_PACKAGE
                  artifacts/serial_update_packages/<device>/sonora_<device>_<tag>_<time>.sfb
                  Serial update support only. Send it to a board that already
                  has a FACTORY_IMAGE to switch it to this application without
                  a programmer. Kept as history: -Clean / -Full never delete it.
                  Filed per device, and named for it as well, because a package
                  built for the other part is a valid file that only fails once
                  it is on the board.

  With serial update support the application HEX is not programmable on its own
  (its reset vector lives in the bootloader), so it is not offered as a product.
  The resident bootloader is built automatically when missing or older than its
  sources. -FirmwareVersion stamps the package header (default 1). -NoDelivery
  builds the application only and leaves nothing to flash.

Superseded parameters (still accepted):
  -Configuration  one-shot override; its device still decides whether serial
                  update support can apply.
  -Preset         now called a profile; -Preset for the other application
                  remaps the configuration accordingly.
  -App            deprecated and ignored except as a cross-check.

      What the old check said: "the stack ends exactly at the diagnostic block". That
      was two invariants written as one equality, and it only held while the stack was
      the last thing in RAM. Section-attributed data (space(ymemory)) is allocated
      from the top of the Y window DOWNWARD, so the stack now sits in the hole below
      it and the equality fails on a perfectly correct layout.

      The two invariants, separated, are both still checkable:

        1. The stack never reaches into the diagnostic block -- above it the stack
           would overwrite the trap record on the way to reporting it -- and it does
           not overlap allocated data either.
        2. Every byte between the top of the stack and the diagnostic block is claimed
           by an allocated section. That is what the equality really bought: no
           unaccounted hole at the top of RAM, and no orphan parked in the reservation.

      Plus a floor under the stack itself, because the stack is no longer "whatever is
      left" and can now be squeezed by a data section with nothing complaining. An
      actual overflow is still caught by SPLIM and reported by _StackError, so the
      floor is a margin check rather than the only defence.

      dsPIC33AK128_SERIAL_UPDATE on 2026-08-15. This is kept, not deleted with them,
      because standalone survives as a delivery MODE and the next part to arrive
      arrives without a bootloader. It is the more important of the two, because a standalone
      build has no packaging step to catch a mistake later. If the download engine
      leaks in, or the layout quietly shifts to the serial-update window, the build
      still succeeds and produces a programmable HEX; the symptom appears on a
      board.

      The claim being defended is the one the resident_de folder split was for: with
      delivery support off, the tree must be indistinguishable from a build that has
      no bootloader concept at all. That is asserted here rather than argued in a
      document, and asserted on the LINKED result -- the map -- not on the sources
      or the configuration, because those are the inputs, and it is the output that
      gets flashed.

      Every value is read from the map, including the link command line the linker
      echoes into its head, so nothing here duplicates a setting that could drift.
      All findings are collected and reported together: a layout regression normally
      shows several symptoms at once, and discovering them one rebuild at a time is a
      slow way to learn that.

      build that produced them (and -Clean; see the directory choice below).
      Collisions within the same minute get a _NN suffix rather than overwriting -
      two builds in one minute are usually a change worth keeping both of.

      packages do I have" is a directory listing rather than a reading of names -- and
      the device in the name is what survives the file being dragged out of it, which is
      exactly what happens on the way to an XMODEM send. Neither alone is enough: an
      AK512 package sent to an AK128 does not fail as a wrong file, it is refused later
      by the manifest's layout_id, or (before that existed) accepted and run.
